            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Reverend, The LEGAL CLERGY <hi>OF</hi> The Reformed Proteſtant Church OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Author <hi>Wiſhes many dayes of conſolation here, and eternal joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lamented after the Lord, when the Ark was removed, and it pittyed the children of <hi>Sion</hi> to ſee her ſtones in the duſt, and how can any ſing a ſong of the Lord in a ſtrange Land? For my own part, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been the troubles of
<pb facs="tcp:121658:3"/>my ſpirit (Right Reverend) for the deſolations and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that have of late befallen our Engliſh Church; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, this has not been, the leaſt affliction of my ſoul, to ſee her, like <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> murdered of her own ſons, to ſee her laid deſolate, whilſt her enemies cry, <hi>There, there, ſo would we have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, ſhe became an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto ſtrangers; and our Engliſh <hi>Sion</hi> being now laid waſte, a <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Tower of <hi>Rome</hi> would fain be built by the Enemy upon our holy Hill.</p>
            <p>But that which moſt afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, was, to ſee the ſons of our <hi>Sion</hi>'s Tower, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly furniſhed out of her ſpiritual Magazine, and being harneſſed, and carrying bowes to reſiſt the Darts of Satan,
<pb facs="tcp:121658:3"/>ſhould like the children of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> turn their backs in the day of battel, amongſt whom I finde Doctor <hi>Vane,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a Book intituled, <hi>The loſt ſheep returned home,</hi> to be the Ring leader and chief of the Apoſtate-Tribe; who had no fooner eſcaped out of our Engliſh ſheep-fold, but ſtraightway he diſcovers the Muſet thorow which he ſtole, thinking thereby to decoy the reſt of the flock into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>Now I ſeeing this injury done unto our Engliſh Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, though it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to me to make up the fence did preſume to lay theſe thorns in the breach, whereby I might divert the Flock from ſtraying after novelties, and ſeeking after ſtrange Paſtours, and in the interim blind the Wolves, that they ſhould not
<pb facs="tcp:121658:4"/>diſcover the breach that is made in our Pale.</p>
            <p>Some I know will condemn me for preſuming to treat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, being a Theam too high for my reach, and too ſacred for my calling; and with <hi>Socrates</hi> will condemn <hi>Lyſia</hi>'s Oration, as not being ſuitable for him that was to pronounce it. If there be any ſuch amongſt us, I deſire them to take notice, That when the Temple was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (without exception) contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted towards the work, <hi>Ezra</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>The Prieſts, and Levites, and all the children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and appointed the Levites to ſet forward the work, Chap.</hi> 3.8. For my part, I do not deſire to tranſgreſs the bounds of a well-wiſhing <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> I do not with <hi>Uzzah</hi> think to ſupport the Ark with my own hand,
<pb facs="tcp:121658:4"/>but humbly preſent to your judicious ſenſe, the ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling flowers which grow in others Gardens; and withal, give your Reverendſhips a view of the wilde Thiſtles that bear no Figgs; leaving it to your choyſe to weed out the one, and root up the other, to whom the work more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs. For my part, had I not perceived that the hearts of many of the Romiſh Faction were hardened through the deceitfulneſs of that Book, inſomuch that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny began to triumph over the wounds therein given to our Engliſh Church, as if the Proteſtant Religion were neckt in the ſparring blowes; And had I not been upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daily with the clamorous inſultings of divers Papiſts, that our Church wanting grounds of Replyes, was the
<pb facs="tcp:121658:5"/>cauſe of her ſilence; I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given them this occaſion to cenſure me of preſumption, or buſied my ſelf either for their information, or the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the one more properly belonging to anothers charge, the other needleſs, in reſpect the quarrel they have renewed, is but with their own ſhadow; all that ever they now pretend being heretofore fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; the force of Divinity, and weight of Reaſon, adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Garland to our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Church.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers being in ſeveral pieces, and many not having the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books, and the Doctor having couched many ſubject matters in one Volume, I thought it requiſite that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply were compoſed in anſwer to his objections; not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb facs="tcp:121658:5"/>of his ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the eaſe and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the people to have him anſwered in one piece, calling upon ſome to this work.</p>
            <p>And I conſulting with my ſelf, and imagining (after ſo long a time of its not being anſwered) that the more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious amongſt you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think it below them to make a reply to that, which had already by others been moſt fully and plainly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, anſwered) did aſſume the boldneſs to re-capitulate this enſuing Treatiſe, which (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my ſelf) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at your feet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amphion</hi> plaid ever beſt, when he heard poor <hi>Ithoneus</hi> blow upon his Oaten Pipe; and I could wiſh theſe rude Collections of mine might but ſerve as a Plain-ſong,
<pb facs="tcp:121658:6"/>whereon your Reverendſhips might deſcant.</p>
            <p>I did not intend that theſe looſe pieces thrown into the Gap, ſhould ſtand for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fence for our Engliſh Vine-yard; onely I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing confident, that they might be ſerviceable to you, and be made uſe of in part, as being Materials prepared for your uſe, wherewith you might firmly repair the Breach which the Doctor has made; which being ſet by your more Divine hands, might become a growing Rampire againſt the Wolves and Foxes that would ſteal into your Vine-yard, to pluck your Grapes, and a ſtanding Bulwark to keep her up, maugre the engines of Hell and Satan.</p>
            <p>I know it is you, to whom the charge of the Plantation
<pb facs="tcp:121658:6"/>is committed, it is you that are the proper Husband-men, and know beſt how to fence her cluſters; you are the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites muſt repair the breaches in our Engliſh Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that I have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Gap made in your Fence, but rather let this my boldneſs finde pardon from your goodneſs, and let this piece be acceptable to you, as coming from one, that in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and love deſires you to have an eye to this breach; and if (when you view the pieces I have thrown into the Gap) you finde any that are proper for your Fence, fix it down, and throw the reſt by; or if (in your judgements) you think it need no further repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet vouchſafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it with your holy hand: &amp; ſith this bold action meerly
<pb facs="tcp:121658:7"/>proceeded from my earneſt affection, and love unfeigned towards my brethren of your houſhold; and to manifeſt my deſire to be folded under your charge, I humbly beg, that you would favorably interpret the the truths, and gently correct the errors of the ſame; and that againſt all malicious and injurious encounters of the Enemy, both I and it may find ſhelter under your wings. In confidence whereof, I remain (upon my knees asking your Fatherly <hi>Benediction</hi> upon your obedient ſon in Chriſt Jeſus, and)</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121658:9"/>Reaſon, nor by Reliance upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity humane. And that God revealed all theſe things to Jeſus Chriſt, and he to his Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. to the end that they ſhould deliver them to Mankinde, to be received, beleeved, and obeyed over the whole world, even to the end thereof; bidding them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Go and teach all Nations;</hi> and that they did accordingly teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20.

               <p>The Doctor (if the Author of that Book) plays the part of a careful buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſeek out a good Foundation; but they who pleaſe to examine his work, will finde he proves himſelf a bungling work-man; for he goes on without line or level in order to this Foundation, and preſently his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures finde new bottoms: His eyes may be lifted up to the hills, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:121658:9"/>his purpoſe might be to have builded upon the Rock; but his minde is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently changed, his Meditations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently become earthly, and his hands are found ſcratching in the ſand: with the Lark he begins to ſing and mount up towards Heaven, but his weak quils preſently flag; he comes down and builds a neſt below upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>In his firſt leaf he profeſſes the Church built upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that nothing elſe is to be beleeved as matter of Faith, but what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of them; and then preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he brings in the Traditions of <hi>Rome</hi> for his ground of all: So that they who pleaſe to compare the frontiſpiece of that work with the inward rooms of the whole building, will finde it to be like <hi>Julian</hi> his picture, which whil'ſt Chriſtians (according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Law) bowed unto it, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, he having put falſe gods in the picture, that they might unwittingly adore thoſe cunningly included Idols. The Frontiſpiece of that Book invites every Chriſtian Soul to take up its lodging within that Tabernacle, which being further riffled into, it proves a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121658:10"/>painted Sepulchre. The faireſt Apples are not always the ſoundeſt at the heart; no more may the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of that Book be judged by the Introduction: for who pleaſes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that Frontiſpiece with the matter contained in the following Chapters, muſt confeſs, when he meditates upon the Introduction, Here is the chief Corner-Stone in <hi>Sion,</hi> elect and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but when, upon the following matter, that there he meets with the craſied pieces of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the rubbiſh and trumpery of humane Inventions; here the chief head of the corner, which the Doctor having forſaken, is become a ſtone of ſtumbling, a rock of offence: there the rotten principles of mans framing, for want of this Foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, ſink under the vain top ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has towered upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phariſees made broad their Phylacteries,</hi> which S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. compares to certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who carried up and down <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula Evangelia,</hi> thinking by thoſe Spells to be free from danger: and it may be the Doctor thinks the reſt of his Book ſhall eſcape cenſure for its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121658:10"/>ſake, but he muſt not think to eſcape by reaſon thereof; it doth rather encreaſe, then extenuate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. <hi>Seneca</hi> witneſſeth, that the Heathen reputed it an indignity to the Emperor, that any ſhould <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Imaginem obſcaenis inferre,</hi> much more ſhould Chriſtians beware how they engrave our Saviours name upon vain and unſuitable pieces. If <hi>Achan</hi> have any thing execrable conſecrated, his Tent muſt be ſearched, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh garment with the wedg of gold (though hid in the midſt thereof) muſt be ranſack'd, and expoſed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique defacing or utter demoliſhing: And muſt the Doctor think, becauſe he has written upon the Portal <hi>IHS,</hi> that his new built Babel, ſtanding upon another <hi>Baſis,</hi> and not upon that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone, ſhall be free from winds and ſtorms? No: ſuch Paper Buildings muſt expect that their lofty fames muſt bury their heads in their ſandy bottoms, and ſerve for no other uſe then to adminiſter comfort to them that ſtand upon the Rock, beholding the ruines of <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Introduction,</hi> as it ſtands in that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121658:11"/>Book, ſerves for an <hi>Index,</hi> to ſhew from what the Doctor is fallen, from a practique to a ſpeculative Religion, from a Church built upon Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to a Synagogue of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who having caſt aſide the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, prefer their own humane Inventions, which meerly tend to the vaſſaling of Princes, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon all the Churches of Gods Saints; who preſcribing rules to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, become lawleſs unruly Maſters of all, making the whole World, as it were, an Aſs for the triple-crown'd Pope to ride on, who would have it thought humility in him to beſtride ſo dull a Beaſt.</p>
               <p>It likewiſe ſpeaks the Author a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and unſtedfaſt man; it contains in it ſelf a Contradiction: and as the Doctor now contradicts that Faith he formerly profeſſed, and ſets himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Church he was chriſtened and educated in; ſo his Book contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Introduction, and the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction contradicts it ſelf, both being the fruits of the ſpirit of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121658:11"/>he ſays, <hi>Peter is Prince of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi> in the latter end he ſays, <hi>The Church is built upon the Apostles ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, Jeſus being the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone:</hi> and in Chap. 20. he ſays, <hi>It is built upon Peter alone, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe varieties of his unſetled Opinions reſults this Concluſion, That Proteſtants can neither take courage to follow after him, nor Papiſts gather any aſſurance (from this experience of his temper) of his non-recoyling.</p>
               <p>I hope his change proceeded not out of hardneſs of heart, that he for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ends ſhould, againſt his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſet himſelf againſt his Mother Church, but onely out of ſome failings in his Judgment: and therefore I have adventured to lay open the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Church is called <hi>Catholique</hi> in ſeveral reſpects: 1. In reſpect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121658:12"/>of places, as being ſpread univerſally through the whole world, and is not tyed to any place or Kingdom. 2. In reſpect of Times, becauſe but one Church of all Times; it having ever been from the beginning of the World, and ſhall continue on Earth till the end thereof; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. the Church of both Teſtaments being one and the ſame. 3. In reſpect of the Collective Body thereof, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church being gathered of men of both Teſtaments, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints being the union and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of all the Saints in Chriſt their Head; according to that of <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That he might gather together in one all things, both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth even into Chriſt;</hi> who is and ever ſhall be King and Head thereof. And generally when we ſpeak of the Catholique Church, this Collective Church is to be underſtood; which appellation, <hi>Catholique,</hi> was uſed by the Apoſtles before ever <hi>Rome</hi> was a Church: So that neither in reſpect of Place, Time, or Catholiqueneſs, may <hi>Rome</hi> juſtly challenge the onely Title of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121658:13"/>
                  <hi>Catholique,</hi> ſhe being but a particular part or member of this Catholique Church, we the Saints being the Body and Members for our part, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. But for the better illuſtration of this Point, I will examine the Doctors Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in particular, concerning <hi>Romes</hi> Catholiqueſhip; and I ſhall in ſo doing more plainly diſprove her Title thereunto.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Catholique,</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Doctor, is not a word of Belief onely, but of Communion alſo: So that, that Church which holds the ſame Belief with the ancient Church, and yet doth not communicate with her, may not rightly be called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> I ſhall retort this Argument which he intended againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and prove it to be their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> own Condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catholique,</hi> as I ſaid, in a general ſence comprehendeth all the Elect, and is the full Body of Chriſt that filleth all things in all things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And when we in our <hi>Creed</hi> ſay, <hi>We beleeve in the Holy Catholique Church,</hi> it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all the Elect of God, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:121658:13"/>have been, are, or ſhall be; of which the Church-Militant on Earth is but part. But becauſe I ſuppoſe the Doctor means onely of a Church upon Earth, I will therefore inſiſt upon his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, and treat of the Church upon Earth, which, as it is univerſally ſpred over the Earth by the Apoſtles, who had equal commiſſion to teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no one particular Church can or ought to claim to be the Catholique or Univerſal Church upon Earth.</p>
               <p>As for the Diſtinction which the Doctor makes betwixt Doctrine and Diſcipline, thereby to excuſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſtile of <hi>Roman Catholique;</hi> That is (ſays he) <hi>Catholique</hi> in reſpect of Doctrine, <hi>Roman</hi> in reſpect of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: That will no ways ſtrengthen her claim, or clear her incongruous Title: He doth but thereby ſhew the World how diſtinct her Diſcipline is from her Doctrine, and thereby give occaſion to the world to ſuſpect both: And upon this ſcore may the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> be called the <hi>Geneva Catholique Church;</hi> that is, <hi>Geneva</hi> for Diſcipline, <hi>Catholique</hi> for Doctrine, ſhe profeſſing the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

               </p>
               <p>It cannot be denyed but that there were other Churches of ancienter and more reverend ſetlement then the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Churches in the Eaſt, as <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, &amp;c.</hi> and in after-times the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was to be carryed before Kings, and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> being by Jeſus ordained a Miniſter and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> amongſt whom <hi>Rome</hi> was then a chief City, which as ſhe received the Faith by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or S. <hi>Peter,</hi> cannot properly be called a Mother Church, but as a babe and ſuckling received the ſincere milk of the Word: She was one of the places to which the Doctrine of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church of Chriſt was extended, but no extender of that Doctrine. So that by the Doctors own definition, ſhe cannot properly be called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, ſhe being in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution but a private particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholique Church, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> or any other Church planted by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:121658:15"/>the Embaſſadors of Chriſt. And if ſince, by the indulgent favors of her nurſing Fathers, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, ſhe has grown to that maturity that ſhe has many Daughter Churches of her own plantation in the dark corners of the old known, and the new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered parts of the World; yet ſhe cannot by reaſon thereof aſſume to her ſelf any more ſuper-intendency over them as their Mother, then <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from whence <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent after he had the laying on of hands, or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> from whence it is pretended <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to have came, may by the ſame rule challenge over her and hers a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction as Mother to her and them.</p>
               <p>And as in reſpect of extention of Doctrine ſhe may not aſſume the name of <hi>Catholique;</hi> ſo neither can ſhe claim that Title to her ſelf in reſpect of her Communion with the Primitive Churches, as every point of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe will evidently ſhew: So that unleſs the Univerſality of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Juriſdiction ſhe claims from <hi>Peter</hi> will ſupport this her Title and Dignity, ſhe is altogether at a loſs, and muſt henceforth diſcontinue her claim
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:121658:15"/>to be the onely Catholique Church. It reſts therefore to examine, That,</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:121658:30"/>ſcore, for by them it appears that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ought not to remove his See, and if he did, it was void. And the Doctor confeſſes <hi>fol.</hi> 288. he was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and if ſo, he ought not to remove his See, unleſſe you wil make him above Councells, and that is plain in the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> to the contrary, of which I ſhall ſpeak at large in the chapter of Councells: and to ſay that by any revelation he came thither, &amp; planted his See there, that were to deny the holy Spirit to the general Councels, who declare the contrary to that Revelation, and ſo they wil make the Church fallible, of which in the eighth chapter. It might be that upon ſome extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaies) he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to withſtand <hi>Simon Magus; Paul</hi> deſiring his aſſiſtance, he might come to <hi>Rome,</hi> but without all doubt he was never Biſhop there, for it is both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the teſtimony of Scripture, and the infrence of Councells.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I conceive that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> though (I confeſſe) I am ſomething induced to believe he might be there, for that the Biſhops

               </p>
               <p>Thus theſe grave Fathers of <hi>Rome,</hi> like the Elders that would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed <hi>Suſanna,</hi> cannot agree in a ſtory, they would deſpoil other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their Rights and Priviledges, and aſcribe all Juriſdiction to their own See; but examine them apart, and they cannot agree how and by what means to derive their title thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for who pleaſe to examine <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, Onup rius, Genebrard, Sabellicus, Anaſtatius, Baronius,</hi> and ſuch like Pope Paraſites about this point of Succeſſion from <hi>Peter,</hi> will find them agree like a dog about a bone; &amp; like <hi>Aeſops</hi> dog, they ſnatch at he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and let go what they had; they that might univerſally lord it over all other Churches of the world, wil needs give <hi>Peter</hi> a ſtrange power, and tye that power to themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they could have been content to have acknowledged themſelves Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121658:31"/>to <hi>Paul,</hi> as he having been Biſhop there, and being the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, I perſwade my ſelf that no Churches of this Weſtern world, but would give the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the right hand of fellowſhip; but ſith the boundleſſe ambition of the Pope carries them beyond all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of fellowſhip, it makes others to ſet their ambitious ends at defiance, and to ſtand faſt to that Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to which they are called, only to beware they uſe it not as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the fleſh, but by love to ſerve one another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>I have I hope ſufficiently proved, that <hi>Rome</hi> may not challenge to her ſelf any univerſality in reſpect of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> having been there; for that it is not altogether cleare and manifeſt that he was there, or if he was there, that he was Biſhop there, or if he was, it makes not much for them to prove any univerſality to the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops in that See; and if from <hi>Peter</hi> no univerſality will ariſe to them, it reſts to examine whether they may claim it by conſent of Councells.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As for the Allegation of thoſe, who ſay we firſt received the faith from <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> it is falſe, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt the current of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as may appear by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> himſelf, who writing to King <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> an Epiſtle, ſayes, <hi>Ye have received of late, through Gods mercy, in the realm of Britain, the Law and Faith of Christ; Ye have with you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm, both the parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, out of that Law; take ye a Law (by Gods grace) with the Councell of your Realm and by that Law; through Gods ſufferance, rule ye your Kingdome of Britain, for you be Gods Vicar in your Kingdome, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it appears, that this Iſle
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121658:43"/>had received the faith before that, and had the Scriptures with them before, and therefore the Papiſts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brag that <hi>Rome</hi> is the only diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of thoſe ſacred Oracles, of which in the eighth chapter.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121658:44"/>and the holy Scriptures, which could not otherwiſe have come, but by the Miſſion of ſome of the Apoſtles, or by ſome ordained by them to that purpoſe, of which more at large in the fourth chapter.</p>
               <p>Reverend <hi>Bede</hi> ſeems to incline, that we firſt received our faith from the Eaſt, for that our Eaſter was kept almoſt a thouſand years after Chriſt, after the manner of the Eaſt in the full Moon, what day ſoever it fell upon, and not on the Sunday, and not after the Romane cuſtome.</p>
               <p>The like doth <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> teſtifie of the Scots, that they kept their Eaſter after the manner of the Greek Church, and not after the Romane, by which they collect, that the firſt planters of the Faith here came from the Eaſt: but I ſhall not much ſtand upon that, for it makes nothing for the preſent point; for whether we received the faith from the Eaſt, or from <hi>Rome,</hi> by the means of <hi>Paul,</hi> I hope none will affirm, but that we are of Apoſtolicall Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having a Metropolitan of our own, and being a diſtinct Province of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121658:44"/>it ſelf, have right to the provinciall Juriſdiction, declared and confirmed by the firſt Councells, which makes us ſo free of our ſelves, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we may juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her to be the univerſall Church.</p>
               <p>And ſith there is no expreſſe and poſitive proof that our firſt planter of the Faith was ſent immediately from the Eaſt, and ſith the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that belief are but bare conjecturalls, I ſhould hold it more proper to admit what is deſired from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe ſent <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>A imathea</hi> hither, or that he was ſent by <hi>Philip,</hi> who was ſent from <hi>Paul,</hi> and that becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, to carry the Goſpell unto them, and would the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not forſake ſuch a Paſtor, to feign one by traditionall ſtories, againſt that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Primitive Church teached, we ſhould willingly give her the right hand, and honor her as our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Siſter, and in order to the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern plantations from <hi>Paul,</hi> and I believe the Churches of <hi>Germany, France, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. would do
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:121658:45"/>the like, not that they prefer <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Peter,</hi> but becauſe Chriſt had ordained <hi>Paul</hi> a Miniſter over them, and the Scriptures and Councells forbid any to intrude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anothers plantation, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Peter</hi> being reproved for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, he being appointed over them of the Circumciſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſſe <hi>Rome</hi> will lay claim to <hi>Paul</hi> for her Biſhop, they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her that primacy of order they heartily wiſh ſhe were honored with: but I much fear, whileſt the Ignatian tribe are ſuffered to put in practiſe the imperious Dictates of the Scarlet Conclave, this will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be embraced, their whole ſtudy is to aſcribe all pomp and power to the Papall throne, being in hopes to be maſters of that Seat e're they die, (it being by their new order of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Popes, not transferrable to any other) and ſo to enjoy their long ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Dominion, and having by a long expectation ſo ſharpned their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and ſet it on ſo keen an edge, they greedily gape after all honor and Soveraignty, and think the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121658:45"/>world too narrow a Province for them to Lord it in; whereas if prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of order would ſerve their turn, none of the Weſtern world would deny it to them; and as the caſe ſtands with the Eaſtern Churches, they, I am perſwaded, would not bogle to condeſcend hereunto; but by no means let her ever hope to have a ſupremacy of Iuriſdiction, ſhe may force it, but never by argument e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it; and ſo according to its firſt beginning, proſecute to rear up her tower of Univerſality, with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bloud, which whilſt ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes, ſhe forges her Keys into a two-edged ſword, and when ſhe has done, ſhe like a Heathen Roman deſtroys her ſelf, by cutting off ſome of her fellow-members, robbing them of what belongs to their office, and makes them uſeleſſe pieces of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body Chriſt Jeſus, of which all the Churches upon earth are fellow-members, and though many, yet make but one body, being all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one body, by one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. Let us therefore follow the truth in love, and in all things
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:121658:46"/>grow up unto him which is the Head, that is Chriſt, by whom all the body being compleat and knit together, by every joynt, for the forniture thereof (according to the effectuall power which is in the meaſure of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part) receiveth encreaſe of the body, unto the edification of it ſelf in love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The Doctor confeſſes that Chriſt is the Head originally, but the Pope is the Head derivatively, for ſayes he, with as much reaſon may we deny a King to be Head of his Kingdome, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, God is King over all the earth, as deny the Pope to be Head of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is ſo; To which I anſwer, Chriſt is the Head of the Catholike Church, that is, comprehenſive of all the Elect,

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121658:46"/>Princes and Magiſtracy is to rule over them (which I judge to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reaſon of the Law of Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries.) Now for the Pope to claim an univerſall headſhip over them, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rob Chriſt of his office, or to deny <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due; for as Head of the whole Catholike Church he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot be, and to be Head of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church upon earth, is not conſiſtent with the plantations of the other Apoſtles, nor was any ſuch univerſall headſhip delegated to any one of the Apoſtles; Chriſt ſent out his Apoſtles to all Nations, and they ordained ſpirituall heads and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors over their ſeverall plantations, none being to intrude upon anothers foundation, and ever ſince Chriſt, there have been ſuperintendents o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſeverall Churches, yet thoſe ſuperintendents were equal amongſt themſelves, none lording it over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only within their diſtinct territories did equally exerciſe the authori y of their headſhip, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one within his own Province being repreſentative in point of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of Chriſt the myſticall Head,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:121658:47"/>without aſcribing a ſingle univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to any one of them, although by this means there be many headſhips over the ſeverall plantations, yet it doth no more deſtroy the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative headſhip of Chriſt here on earth, then the Spaniſh, French, &amp;c. acknowledging obedience to their diſtinct Princes are againſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, becauſe the Turk claims to be Soveraign Lord of the Univerſe: Wherefore if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wil needs have the Catholike Church to be underſtood only of a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church upon earth, and ſome one Biſhop to be the governing head thereof, I muſt tell her, that ſhe can lay no juſt claim hereto, becauſe if <hi>Peter</hi> had any power above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, it doth not appear to ſucceed to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that it is not proved <hi>Peter</hi> to have been Biſhop there, and if he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there, yet there wants a cleare and perfect deraigning of ſucceſſion from him, ſome affirming <hi>Linus,</hi> ſome <hi>Clemens,</hi> ſome <hi>Anacletus</hi> to ſucceed him, and ſome Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> claiming as Succeſſors to <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:121658:47"/>ſome to <hi>Peter:</hi> or if they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Succeſſion, yet it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Peters</hi> power did ſucceed to them, in reſpect it was Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in him, and either died in him, or ſurvived to <hi>Iohn;</hi> beſides, they cannot agree in the manner how this power of ſupremacy ſhould be in them; for if they have it as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhops, <hi>Gregory</hi> declares it, and the Doctor confeſſes it to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian; for that hereby they deny others to be Biſhops, and ſo rob them of their divine order, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtique Juriſdiction, granted by conſent of Councells to Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, to govern within their provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall precincts, without appealing to <hi>Rome,</hi> and if they will have it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſee how they make <hi>Rome</hi> the Rock, not <hi>Peter,</hi> and go againſt the Symbole of our faith. The Apoſtles, who compoſed the Creed (as the Doctor confeſſes 148.) and profeſſing faith in the Catholike Church, did publiſh that Creed at Jeruſalem, before ever the faith was preached at <hi>Rome,</hi> and when her Church was inviſible, or not in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

               <p>Wherefore for theſe reaſons, I hope I may, without incurring a cenſure of preſumption, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence affirm, that <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Catholique Church, nor the Pope the univerſall Head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, either in reſpect of any Juriſdiction derived from <hi>Peter,</hi> or by the conſent of Councells, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deraigning any title thereto.</p>

               <p>The Church of God is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men choſen by him to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name, and therefore did the Apoſtles term it <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> alluding to the cuſtome of <hi>Arkens,</hi> to call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the people, to hear the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of any Law, or any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Oration, and not Synagogue, that is an inordinately met aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, without a lawfull calling together, wherefore we ſay that <hi>Eccleſia</hi> in the moſt proper and genuine ſignification, is <hi>

<note place="margin">Ante 33.4 chap.</note> For what if all the Biſhops ſhould die ſo neer at one time, that none were left ordained by them, ſhall not the Presbytery make Biſhops? they have right to the Keyes, which are called <hi>Claves eccleſiae non epiſcoporum,</hi> and they are

But if this opinion be by the learned condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I ſhall ſubmit, and yet with

For firſt, in <hi>Hen</hi> 8. time the controverſie was about Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; which queſtion the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Pope occaſioned, (though I doe not juſtifie that Prince for all he did) and being once ſtarted, it gave occaſion of further ſcrutiny into the primitive Fathers and Councels,
<note place="margin">Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>England.</hi> Infra 55.5 chap.</note> which did ſo far perſwade the Conſciences of the then Clergy, that many of them did adhere to the Prince againſt the Pope, and by that and other after inquiſitions, they found they had primitive right of calling Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and reforming things amiſſe in their Church without appealing to <hi>Rome;</hi> and thereupon having the authority of Scriptures, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and Fathers, they reſtored to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:121658:76"/>themſelves their juſt rights, and ſhook off their ſervile obedience to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Popes continued over them, by keeping them up in ignorance, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them their own judgements and illumination eccleſiaſticall to underſtand the plain letter of any thing, be it never ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the eaſieſt capacity without his Holineſſe interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and having thus ſhaken off that ſlaviſh yoke of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſcales of blind obedience fell from their eyes, and they clearly perceived the Popes falſe cunning, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable abuſings of Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councels, and what not, thorow his unjuſt uſurpations of univerſality, and infallibility, whereby he became a new Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Divine rules of Faith, which had in them too much of groſſe and fleſhly compoſitions, tending meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enſlave Chriſtendome, and to ſet up the Popes triple Crown; for all the people to worſhip, thereby making them forſake Chriſt, and his Truth, for the fables

               <p>And as In <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were not turned out; ſo neither at the coming of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Crown, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their Biſhopricks, excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their function, ordaining others as formerly, onely the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Elie, Lincoln, Bath, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> were outed, and the Biſhops of Saint <hi>Aſaph, Bangor, London</hi> and <hi>Cheſter</hi> fled; the reſt continued, and ordained others: The Queen her ſelf being Enaugurated by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> one of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Biſhops, and Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle;</hi> and <hi>Parker,</hi> the Arch-biſhop was conſecrated by the Impoſition of Hands of <hi>Barlow, Coverdale,</hi> and <hi>Korey;</hi> three of Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and two ſuffragan Biſhops more, as appears by the act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration: for that our ſucceſſion was not totally interrupted; or if it had, I hold that ſucceſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops is no inſeparable mark of a true Church; for if ſo, then where
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:121658:77"/>was the Church before Chriſt,

               <p>And whereas the Doctor objects, that we are beholding to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops, if our ſucceſſion was not interrupted; I have already proved that we had Sacramentall Orders at leaſt, if not governing Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſent any Prieſts into <hi>England;</hi>

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and though all of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inſtitution were extinct, yet we continue a ſucceſſion; for that ſtill we are <hi>pars eccleſiae,</hi> though Hereticks: But that's but their begging of the queſtion, we appeal to the Scriptures, primitive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells and Fathers to Judge, who are of us two the Sciſmaticks or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and I ſubmit to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reader to cenſure, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us in the points here contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, whether <hi>Rome</hi> or we be in the Errour.</p>
               <p>Thus briefly I have anſwered the Doctors condemning of us for want of Succeſſion; and have in ſome ſort proved that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot properly be ſaid a true Church in reſpect of her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,

               <p>The Doctor, nor any other muſt not boaſt of the Truth of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this reſpect; for if they make this an abſolute Signe, then in reſpect their Popes the Head of that Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be above Councels, have been wicked, it followes that ſhe is not the true Church: I muſt confeſſe, that where this Mark is to be found, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, of a true Church; it is a perſwaſive argument, but no poſitive ſigne of a true Church: In the twelve Apoſtles one was a Devil, yet God made him the Inſtrument to bring to paſſe our Salvation: the Devill confeſſed Chriſt, we muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny him.

                  <hi>That the Church of Rome cannot be reputed and taken for a true Church in reſpect of Miracles: and of her abuſe in maintaining Images in the Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Doctor is pleaſed to argue the truth of Romes Church from her miracles; and he ſhewes that he has not travelled beyond Seas for nothing: <hi>eſt natura hominum novitatis avida:</hi> he has been peeping into her Legenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-ſtories, that he might be furniſhed (upon the authority of a traveller) to ſend news to <hi>England.</hi> For my own part, I dare not give up my ſelf to ſuch deluſions as it is wel known the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uſes towards the people to gaine their faith to believe in his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Pope, as to credite the moſt (ſcarce any) of her miracles: and that the rather, for that it has been by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience found out (eſpecially in <hi>England</hi>) that moſt of them were feigned, and invented only to cheat the people into a blind obedience; and I perſwade my ſelf, if the Doctor had known as much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:121658:99"/>as I do, by the reading of hiſtories in this point (which hiſtories may as well chalenge belief as the humane tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Rome</hi>) he would never have inſiſted upon this mark: but as it fares with men that are groping in the dark, ſometimes to run their heads againſt poſts; ſo the Doctor having forſook the light he was in, and as yet being not well acquainted with the windings and ſtranges mazes that are in the dark cloiſters to which he has betaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at unawares he daſhes his head againſt the door of miracles, which makes him recule with affront: but I'll ſo much be his friend, that I'll help him to revenge his quarrel; I'll pick the lock, and furniſh him out of her ſtores with miraculous knick-knacks.</p>
               <p>It were to make this book ſwell with impoſſible trumperies,
<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> to report the thouſand part of her legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſtories; as that Saint <hi>Dennis</hi> carryed his head in his hand after it was ſtrucken off; and of Saint <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the firſt, who being caſt into the Sea with a milſtone about his neck, the ſea forſook the ſhore three miles, and there was found a Chappel ready built,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:121658:99"/>where his body was beſtowed: and many ſuch like ſtories are to be found in <hi>Bozius de Saguius.</hi> Theſe ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wonders, fill the ears, not the hearts of many; therefore the Doctor might have done well to have followed <hi>Bozius</hi> example, who finding his grand inventions meet with ſmal belief in theſe coaſts, he runs adrift till he came to <hi>Congo, Colachina,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia,</hi> and in his return tels of wonders done there, and ſo gaines of ſome an opinion of belief, who will rather ſeem, for ſatisfaction to the reporter, to lead credulous ears to hiſtory, then upon an unknown ſcore to cenſure him of falſity: wherefore he goes on (with their patience) to tell them that in theſe forrain Indies he did but lay the Goſpel upon a womans breaſt, and the devil flew from her as if he had been ſhot out of a gun; he but ſet up the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the croſs, and an army of horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in glittering armor appeared, whoſe harneſs did dazle the eyes, and whoſe number ſtruck terror into the hearts of the adverſe party. But here in <hi>England</hi> they could do no ſuch feats.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:121658:100"/>
               <p>It may be that where people give up themſelves to believe in them,
<note place="margin">deceivable wonders.</note> their prieſts, as having a power from <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand, Gregory</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and the old Magician Popes may do ſtrange wonders, (as the Doctor confeſſes, <hi>folio</hi> 253. wonders may be done by the power of Antichriſt) but certainly ſuch cannot before the eys of true believers in Chriſt ſhew any wonders at all. And here I deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a ſtory of a Veſtal Nun in <hi>Spaine</hi> which was cryed up for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, inſomuch that when the late King of <hi>England</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> was there, he was over-intreated by the <hi>Infanta</hi> to go to ſee her: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the King, that ſometimes ſhe would be lifted up in the aire, and be as freſh as a Roſe, though ſhe was furrowed with age. The King came with the <hi>Infanta</hi> to her, but ſhe could not do any one feat before the King (though ſhe could never have ſhewen her miracles in a better time.) The King was of too ſtrong a faith for her ſpirit to work upon, and therefore could ſhe ſhew none then <hi>crede quod habes, &amp; habes.</hi> All the anſwer I can give to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:121658:100"/>the ſuppoſed mark of miracles, is, that no good Catholique can well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to credit them; for if he believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and the Pope the head of the univerſal Church, and ſticks to believe theſe ſtories, ſtrives at a gnat and ſwallows a Camel; let him never leap at blocks, and ſtumble at ſtrawes.</p>
               <p>Yet leſt the Doctor ſhould think that I have given up my ſelf to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, becauſe I am ſo hard of belief in this point, I will ſhew him my reaſons for it.</p>
               <p>I know many of her miracles are falſe, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hand over head, has recorded the falſe ones with the true ones; and as the proverb is, We know not how to believe a lyar when he ſpeaks truth. The Doctor confeſſes <hi>fol.</hi> 253. that all her miracles are not true: and if ſhe have Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loguiſed the falſe ones together with the true ones, we know not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them: if I had not the Doctors own confeſſion that ſome are falſe, yet I ſhould not ſeem raſh to any indifferent man, in that I taxe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:121658:101"/>of falſe miracles, for that her teachery and cozenage in this point hath been detected in this particular, it being but held forth to the blind people, that they being ſtruck into admiration of their wonderful power, might with fear and reverence become devotaries to their miraculous inſtruments, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely to thoſe Antique Gods, by which cheat the Clergy obtained no ſmall riches.

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> made the prayer <hi>Ora pro nobis Deum: allelujah</hi> &amp;c. For my part, I believe this; for belike that image was made like to the image of Saint <hi>Grimbald</hi> in the Abby of <hi>Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> which was faſtened to a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:121658:101"/>pillar by a private pin, and a man ſtood privately behind the pillar, and by plucking out of the pin, it might be lifted up by a boy: which poſture they exerciſed to any that freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and if one came niggardly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was immoveable; by which trick the people were made believe, when the Image would yeeld to be taken up that their ſins was pardoned, by reaſon of ſatisfaction made by their offering. There was another Image in the ſaid Abbey, which is more neerly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative with the marble Image of Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> which was made of ſuch curious contrivings, that by certaine wyers a man ſtanding within it might make it frown, ſimile, bow, nod the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which poſtures thoſe which came to offer, knew when they had made ſatisfaction for their ſin, by the pleaſantneſs and acceptance of that carved god; or if they were penurious and ſparing in their offerings, that nimble contrivance of foolery gave them ſome denotement of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and the prieſts were ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret heavy judgements to befall them: or by the ſimiles of that image
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:121658:102"/>(which onely a golden Wyer procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to aſſure them of Gods mercy towards them; and that God ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that to them by his Saint there ſtanding: by which Cheat they got no little advantage.</p>
               <p>The like cheating and Idolatry was exerciſed by means of a Rood at <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyrſt</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and in ſeveral other places of this Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> By which it is evident, that the uſe of Images was not, as the Doctor would perſwade us, onely to put us in mind of the things by them repreſented, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to perſwade the people they were the very immediat inſtruments of God, to ſignifie his will unto us; &amp; did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perſwade the people into adoration of them. And yet, leſt the Doctor's Arguments for their retaining in the Church might ſeem with ſome to be unanſwerable by me, ſhould I paſs this point ſo ſlightly and overly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the uſe of them, becauſe they were abuſed; and leſt I ſhould run into an errour with thoſe which upon that ſcore cry down Biſhops, which, if as they ought to be, are both a ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ornament to the Church; and,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:121658:102"/>in my poor judgement, they may as well deny the Apoſtleſhip, becauſe there was a <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt them: I will not therefore, from the abuſe of any thing, utterly condemn all uſe thereof. It reſts therefore to examine how far the uſe of them may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>The Science of Painting and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is an Art profitable for mans life and is the gift of God.
<note place="margin">Images how far lawful.</note> It is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the memorial of things done; and to that purpoſe have the Pictures and Monuments of Noble-men been uſed through all ages, being a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful memory of thoſe they repreſent: And this Art and Curioſity of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip being an adorning and graceful beautifying of any buildings, the Temples in old time were made ſumptuous therewith; which by the Heathen Perſecutors were, as the Pſalmiſt witneſſes, broke down with axes and hammers, by the enemies of the Church. Yet that amongſt thoſe curious Pieces there were any repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the Godhead, it doth not appear; but rather, the contrary: For it is impoſſible for humane fleſh to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:121658:103"/>draw any thing that ſhall repreſent God by any corporeal or finite image, who is incorporeal and infinite: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.18. <hi>To whom ſhall we liken God? or what ſimilitude ſhall we ſet up unto him?</hi> It is true, that God of old repreſented himſelf in mans ſhape; but we muſt not therefore think to make ſemblances of him: it is lawful for him to do as he pleaſes; but not for us to make ſuch repreſentations of him as are not commanded. Beſides, thoſe viſible ſhapes by which he vouchſafed to appear, had God after a ſpecial manner with them, and in them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to command and hear them to whom he ſo manifeſted himſelf: which cannot be aſcribed to mens repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, which are againſt Gods order; he forbidding us to turn the glory of the incorruptible God into the ſimilitude of a corruptible man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.13. And though ſome urge, that ſuch ſemblances ſerve as Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens books, to teach them to know Chriſt; yet that is no excuſe for the uſe of ſuch, ſith God hath ordained his Church to be taught by his Word and Sacraments, and not by theſe.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:121658:103"/>And whereas the Doctor urges that they ſerve to ſtir up men to give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the thing ſignified by the ſigne; that muſt be underſtood of a true ſigne ordained by him who hath authority to ordain it, and the will of him that is honoured preſcribing the honour to be given to the ſigne: which neither he nor any elſe, can prove that Chriſt ſhould be honoured by ſuch ſignes. And as it is not lawful to make ſuch repreſentations of Him, ſo neither of any creature, to the end to give wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the ſignes, as ſignifications of what they repreſent: And yet I allow that the curious Draughts and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Eccleſiaſtical Stories, and of other Portraictures ſet forth with art and skill, may be uſed to adorn our Churches, ſo that no adoration be given to any ſuch ſignes. Wiſely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Council of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> called by <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Images are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the people</note> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the uſe of Images in the Church: and pernicious was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> declaring the contrary, which hereby gives occaſion of idolatry to the weak. And there being no ground for them
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:121658:104"/>in the Scriptures, but rather againſt them, it were more ſafe (although to the more learned they be no occaſion of offence) to aboliſh them, then to retain the uſe of them in the Church. But I doubt his Holineſs will not eaſily be induced hereunto, in reſpect they are much inſtrumental, by Oblations made to them, to increaſe his book: for he, with the people of <hi>Zachan</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> feeds the Idols onely with the ſmoak of the Offering; himſelf faring deliciouſly by ſuch libations. And although theſe golden pieces, which thoſe wooden gods procure him, be the offerings of ſins, and ſacrificed to Idols; yet, by vertue of his holineſs, he can eaſily waſh that iniquity from them, and teach it for a truth, that when once they are laid up in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs Cheſts, the ſquallid nature of their inquination is changed; and, by a wonderful metamorphoſis, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pure <hi>Peter</hi>-pence: and therefore he will not willingly part with ſuch gainful and profitable inſtruments. They are of double uſe to him: for they do not onely ſerve for the ends of gain, but likewiſe to win the people to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:121658:104"/>obedience, by the ſeeming-miraculous apparitions of them: and therefore by no means muſt the uſe of them be laid aſide. Though of themſelves they are but manimate blocks, yet, as Toys and Rattles pleaſe Babies, theſe delude the ignorant vulgar, ſtriking them into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of them; which is none of the leaſt occaſions of the Papiſts being trained up in ignorance. And whilſt his Holineſs can by their means be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, who can blame him for retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I return to the other Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Miracles, and will ſhut up this Chapter, touching both with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement to thoſe that believe the Miracles of <hi>Romes</hi> Church, as done by the power of God, Not to give themſelves to ſuch deluſion. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor confeſſes, <hi>fol.</hi> 253. that by the power of Antichriſt wonders may be done: and moſt of <hi>Romes</hi> Miracles are known to be Mountebank-jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and the Doctor confeſſes ſome may not be true; and yet ſhe proclaims all for true Miracles, as proceeding from the Spirit of God. She doth not declare out of her Legends which are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:121658:105"/>true and which are falſe. But her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends being filled with ſeveral bundles of them, ſhe delivers all for true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and therefore is credit to be given to none of them, as done by the power of the Spirit of God: for did they work by that Spirit, they would not lye in any one of them.</p>

               <p>IF the church of <hi>Rome</hi> have converted any Church ſince her declining the Apoſtles doctrine, it is no more then what the <hi>Arrians</hi> did unto the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſo by the Doctors own rule, <hi>fol.</hi> 256. ſhe hath not whereof to boaſt: and if other Nations have the Apoſtles doctrine, the pure and primitive faith, they now differing in material points

               <p>The Spaniard and Portugal had the faith of Chriſt firſt preached to them by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt them; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> claimes from <hi>Peter,</hi> who had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to carry the light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and to Kings; For that as I ſaid in the ſecond Chapter, the general commiſſion given to go and teach all Nations,

               <p>Beſides, <hi>Spain,</hi> as I ſaid before, is a diſtinct Province from <hi>Rome,</hi> and has held ſeveral councels without the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> as the ſeveral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Toledo.

<note place="margin">Rome has ſeparated from the Churches more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then her ſelf.</note> And as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot alone be ſaid a true Church, in reſpect of her converting of Nations, ſo may ſhe in no ſort lay any juſt claime to that denomination, in reſpect of the other mark by which ſhe deſires to be diſtinguiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> her non-ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Churches more ancient then her ſelf.</p>

               <p>It is manifeſt that <hi>Rome</hi> has in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points changed her faith,

               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did err after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34.
<note place="margin">Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did err.</note> he was of opinion that the Goſpel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not at all unto the Gentiles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he was informed by a viſion, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:121658:112"/>he ſhould goe to <hi>Cornelius;</hi> for, ſaith he, <hi>I perceive of a truth that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation he that feares him, whether Jew or Gentile, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſs, is accepted with him;</hi> ſo that there was a time whilſt <hi>Peter</hi> was in error; and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. he walked not with a right foot accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the light of the Goſpel; <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood him to his face, and this was not for any ſmal fault, or error of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as the Doct. would perſwade us, for Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi> doth Juſtifie the reprehenſion. Beſides, to ſay it was an error of fact, and not of faith, were to charge Saint <hi>Peter</hi> with diſſimulation either againſt his conſcience or with it: ſure he did it not for any worldly reſpects againſt his conſcience; and if he did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it was his duty in ſo doing, to bear with the weakneſs of the Jews, and to think that a man may diſſemble in ſuch a caſe, then it was matter of faith, whether a man may <hi>in eo caſu diſſimulare,</hi> or no; therefore his error was a matter of faith, not of fact only.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:121658:112"/>
               <p>I need no other Argument to clear this, then what the Doctor has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf framed againſt our propoſed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between fundamentals and not fundamentals in point of error: for ſaith he, <hi>fol.</hi> 88. There is no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of points of faith, in regard of the object or motive for which we believe; namely the truth of God revealed by his Church, we being equally bound to believe all that is by her propoſed to us, whether the matter be great or ſmall.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Doctors argument I infer, That the Church having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before, That the Jews ſhould not eat with the Gentiles, <hi>Peter</hi> did offend againſt this injunction which he ought to have believed, as the truth of God; and therefore it was in him an error of faith. Before the viſion in the 10. of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> was not to preach to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> he was not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Gentiles, and would not go to <hi>Cornelius</hi> before that; and therefore in the 2 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when there were men of all Nations, and ſtrangers from <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and when they every one heard their own language, and therefore
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:121658:113"/>mocked the Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>They were full of new wine; Peter</hi> lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his voice and corrected the men of <hi>Judea,</hi> that was, only them of the circumciſion, and did not intermeddle with the Gentiles, they not belonging to his charge; and therefore did <hi>Paul</hi> reprove him for eating with them.</p>
               <p>Diſſoluteneſs in manners, argues unſoundneſs in opinion, though it be in things wherein the Church has not interpoſed her decree: But if ſhe have injoyned a thing to be done, or not done, though it were indifferent in it ſelf; yet her command takes away the indifferency, upon the Doctors own rule; and therefore <hi>Peters</hi> offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches rule, was error of faith.</p>
               <p>Shall <hi>Peter</hi> the bleſſed Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, be taxed of errors, he being here by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places of Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our Saviour for his failings before he received the Holy Ghoſt, ſhewing hereby he was a man; and after he had received the Holy Ghoſt, doubting to whom the Goſpel was to be preached, and offending againſt the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:121658:113"/>injunctions of the Church, ſhewing hereby he was no God? and ſhall the wicked Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> think much to be taxed of their errors, and daily failings? I might eaſily be reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for injuſtice, ſhould I bury their errors in ſilence, and publiſh to the world Saint <hi>Peters</hi> failings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt lay open their aberrations to the publique view. In proſecution whereof. I will not as a private man chalenge them of error, but only put them in minde what councels, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers of the Church, and their own latter writers, have given them to underſtand.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:121658:116"/>of <hi>Rome,</hi> with his other Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot err, they do hereby make the private Councel of <hi>Rome</hi> above the general Councel; which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and utterly againſt all principles of reaſon and divinity; I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to ſhew that Councels have erred, and therefore, in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatſoever, is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> infallible.</p>
               <p>The Pope is declared above Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,

<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">Infra.</note> with his Court of Cardinals about him, to examine his judical proceedings, and try if they be infallible.</p>
               <p>I would fain know in what capacity the Pope claims this infallibility: by the power of ſucceſſion from <hi>Peter,</hi> I have proved he cannot claime it; and if he claime it as from the conſent of the late councels, then is this his politick capacity dirivative from thence, and muſt not exalt it ſelf above the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:121658:116"/>or admit that thoſe councels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the then preſent Popes infallible, for ſuch certain notes of ſanctity as was to them diſcovered, it doth not follow that their ſucceſſors ſhould be ſo. But that I may put all ſcruples out of mens hearts concerning this point, I will prove that thoſe Councels in themſelves were not infallible, and much leſs any ſubſtituted power of judicature which muſt have its riſe from them.</p>

The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> declared Angels to be circumſcriptible; and the ſouls of men, and that they have bodies, and are viſible, and circumſcriptible; which is againſt the rules of our faith; for we believe that God is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things, viſible and inviſible; and if Angels and Spirits be viſible, then are there no inviſible things (as one argues upon this point.) But I do not much urge this, in regard ſome hold that ſpirits may aſſume viſible ſhapes; nor doth my argument much rely upon this miſtake in that Council. I need not rifle much into Councels, to pick out contradictory Canons, ſith
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121658:118"/>the Councils themſelves declare they are not infallible; inſomuch that the whole Council prayeth, at the end of every Council, in a ſet form of prayer, that God would pardon their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and errors; <hi>&amp; quia conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia remordente, fabeſcimus,</hi> &amp;c. and becauſe our own conſcience accuſing us we do faint, leſt either ignorance hath drawn us into error, and haſty will driven us to decline from thy will and pleaſure of heavenly Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which it appears, that they confeſs the frailty of that Aſſembly, that it may not onely err in matter of fact through ignorance, but in faith alſo, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from juſtice.</p>
               <p>Lame and frivolous therefore are thoſe diſtinctions,
<note place="margin">Alledged that the contrary decrees of later, are but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of former Councils.</note> by which the Papiſts would deceive the world, that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils do but declare and explain the meaning of former Councils, but do never gaineſay any by a contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: for the contrary is abſolutely proved to you already, in that they are diametrically oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and beſides, the four firſt Councils were reputed and taken to be ſo holy, that <hi>Gregor,</hi> the Gr. <hi>in regiſt. primo,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:121658:119"/>libr.</hi> 24. and <hi>Maſilius def. pac. dict.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 229. affirm they are to be believed ſacred <hi>tanquam quatuor Evangelia;</hi> and if a later council ſhall decree any thing contrary to them, it ſhall not be received into the Church. How then can the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſhame claim univerſality to her ſelf, and ſupream juriſdiction? the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being but equal with <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and declared to thoſe Councils, <hi>ſicut Alexandria,</hi> as I have proved in the ſecond chapter. But the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by vertue of her new-acquired attributes of univerſality, infallibility, and ſupremacy, may declare as ſhe pleaſe, and none to queſtion her for it; and ſhe has her champions with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry to make good whatſoever ſhe propoſes; and therefore, whereas thoſe firſt councils were accounted ſacred by the ancient Fathers, even as the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, and therefore none might add to or diminiſh from them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Rome</hi> may, by her new prerogatives, being declared above Councils, do what ſhe pleaſe; and ſo, upon the matter, all Religion is by her made arbitrary, we having neither
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:121658:119"/>Scripture, Fathers, nor Councels, but muſt be interpreted by her, after her own fancy; and no other ſence to be received of any thing, though never ſo plaine, but what ſhe gives; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever interpretation ſhe makes, through never ſo repugnant to the plaine text, words, and ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Councils, and Fathers, muſt not be denyed, but underſtood to be grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and explanations of the firſt faith, ſpun out of the ſtock or <hi>depoſitum Eccleſiae;</hi> with which deluſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of her ſtrange contexture, drawn from her own Spiders womb, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles the leſſer and ſmall flies; but the more ſollid break the net of her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial cunning, and leave her in the ſnare ſhe prepares for others; and hereupon ſhe has in the Council of <hi>Milan</hi> added a new Symbole of faith to the Nicene Creed, which ſhe cals new rules of faith; which indeed, are new articles of faith,
<note place="margin">Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Councils.</note> as common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind; worſhiping images, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be as they would have them, underſtood explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for explanations are declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive illuſtrations of a truth involved in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:121658:120"/>ſome former article, and not additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a doctrine newly conceived for truth.</p>
               <p>I allow that out of the <hi>depoſitum Eccleſiae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Depoſitum Eccleſiae.</note> as the Doctor ſays, <hi>fol.</hi> 123. there may be growings in faith and knowledge, and new articles impoſed upon the people by repreſentatives in collective or Provincial Councels, which upon new queſtions and diſputes may reſolve (being the proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter and reconciler of differences) and by the authority of Scriptures frame new articles, which before were not thought of, as occaſion to that purpoſe may be adminiſtred; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving framed ſuch articles by authority of the Church, may deliver them to be received as matters of faith; by which the people by the approbation of the civil magiſtrate of the reſpective juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions are bound. But if thoſe be contrary to what former Councils have reſolved, it proves their decrees peccant, as <hi>Romes</hi> ſupremacy by the Laterne and Trent Councils, as againſt the firſt Councils of Nice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtontinople: or, if thoſe new rules, or articles of faith, be not warranted
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:121658:120"/>by Scripture, they are not binding to abſent provincials: as I ſhall ſhew in the twelfth Chapter, for it is cleer and evident, that the Scripture is above the authority of any Council that ever was ſince the Apoſtles Council at Jeruſalem; and it ſelf doth, in matters of points neceſſary, judge it ſelf,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Infra.</hi> 102.112.</note> as is in that Chapter plainly proved, though all thoſe points were not at firſt digeſted into a Symbole of faith.
<note place="margin">Scriptures above Councils.</note> For if by authority of explanation, the Church repreſented in ordinary councils ſhall not be bound by Scripture, ſo that ſhe ſhall not frame new rules contrary to the plaine letter, of thoſe points of our ſalvation the Holy Ghoſt has ſet down in the Scriptures; we do then ſubmit the whole matter of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the power of humane judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo make void the dictates of the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, at the wils and diſcretions of mortal men; which though they were Angels ſent from heaven, in that caſe are not to be believed, ſhall they teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that the Apoſtles here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: therefore, I ſay, becauſe all points of ſalvation may not be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodized
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:121658:121"/>into a certaine Symbole and rule of faith, the Church as occaſion may require, may, out of the treaſure of the Scriptures, take new rules; but thoſe rules muſt not impugne the plain letter of Scripture, which, becauſe ſuch a Council is fallible, muſt be made the ſquare and rule to judge that Council by. Now becauſe God has promiſed his Spirit to his Church, and Councils are the repreſentation of Churches; and for that it is more probable, that they ſhall decree according to the rule of Scripture, which every private man in charity ought to think, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to incline himſelf to follow the rules ſhe ſhall prepoſe, I will ſhew how far a Council is Binding.</p>
               <p>It doth not deſtroy the Church of Chriſt univerſally, to ſay that a General Council may err; For concerning the true faith of Chriſt, it is already made known by the preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to moſt parts of the known world: which faith God will have in ſome part of the world, till the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution thereof; for, as I have already ſaid, at one inſtant of time Chriſts Church ſhall not be univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:121658:121"/>The Councils of <hi>Laterane,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the General Councils, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church doth not err.</note> 
                  <hi>Trent, Milan,</hi> and <hi>Nice,</hi> may err from the faith they had formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: But this doth not prove a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal falling away; and any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel that of latter times hath been, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure it ſelf upon the promiſe of Chriſt's Spirit, that it is infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not collective of all parts where the faith of Chriſt is preached; which if it were ſo collective, it argued infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of any private Church to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt their rules. For in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they are repreſentive of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, they have the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with them the Apoſtles had; and though but men, yet by vertue of that Spirit became infallible in their judicial decrees of Articles and Rules of faith. But ſuch a Council was never gathered ſince the Council of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; therefore the later Councils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but repreſentive of particular Churches, as thoſe particular Churches may err, ſo theſe Councils may err.</p>
               <p>For as much as ſince the Apoſtles Councils,
<note place="margin">Who ſhall tax the Councils of errors.</note> there was never any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which was collective of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:121658:122"/>Church, and ſo had the aſſurance of Chriſts Spirit; It is requiſite that every provincial, who by ſuffragan vote is not repreſented there, ſhall examine within his own juriſdiction, how the rules of ſuch Council agree to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which he is already aſſured are of the Holy Ghoſt, and in themſelves prime verities, and to walk according as Gods Spirit ſhal give him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe Scriptures, he being within his own charge and territory, made a diſpenſor of thoſe ſacred oracles: and as for any private man, he is to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rules of the particular Church of which he is a member, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly taxing his mother-Church of error.</p>
               <p>I do not infer hereby, that becauſe there has not lately been,
<note place="margin">How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials are bound by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Councel.</note> or becauſe that it is very difficult (if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to have a general Council col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective of all Chriſtian Churches, that therefore every provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has the ſame efficacy of decreeing, that a General Council, collective of many provinces, hath. For according to the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> 14. <hi>Can.</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> 19. <hi>Can.</hi> I approve of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:121658:122"/>provincials appealing one to another, to decide controverſies, and to bring the the neighbor provinces into unity of faith, that they may ſupport one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by keeping the unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and that it is convenient that ſuch provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals as are repreſented in ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſhould acquieſce in the reſult of that council ſo convened; but not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſuch councils are infallible for that becauſe they proceed upon humane judgements, not being aſſured of the Holy Ghoſt by Chriſts promiſe to his Church, in reſpect they are not a perfect repreſentation of that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church: and as the Scripture is to be the guide to any Council, ſo more eſpecially ſhall it be a rule to others, by which the abſent provincials are to examine the rules of that Council. As for the ſeveral provincials and Sees then by ſuffragan vote repreſented, I hold it fit for them to acquieſce in the reſult of ſuch a collective Council; wherefore, for the further illuſtration of this point, I hold it neceſſary to add a Chapter of the conſtitutions of Councils, thereby the better to lay open this point of

               <p>I look upon her as a bundle of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, not eaſily broke; from whoſe qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the particular Churches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly armed, to reſiſt the fiery darts of Satan. In brief, I honor, reſpect, love, and in all humility reverence her: and when I conſider her in her right conſtitution, I hold my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in a tye of indiſpenſible obedience to conform and ſubmit to whatſoever rules of faith ſhe ſhall conſtitute and appoint: I account her the mother of the particular Churches there repreſented, betwixt whom there is an harmonious intercourſe of reciprocal love and duty; ſhe to acquit her obligations, provides for her daughters their portions, food &amp; raiment, Heavenly Manna, &amp; Chriſt's ſeamleſs coate; and her daughters, to diſcharge their duty, return her a tribute of honor and obedience.

               <p>Theſe are her juſt and proper attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes: and who, without regret, can conſider that this beauteous Lady, the

She has taken the divels counſel, and thrown her ſelf from off the Pinacles of the Temple; and, forſaking the houſe of the Lord, ſhe has erected a houſe which is the way unto the Grave; her houſe tendeth to death, and her paths unto the dead; and for this cauſe many of her former daughter-Churches are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrangers to their mothers womb, and have withdrawn that tribute of honor and reverence which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly aſcribed to her, and give it to

A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council may not only induct one to be Pope, but may compell any Pope to depart from the Popedome by way of authority. And though

               <p>The ſixth canon of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which made <hi>Rome</hi> equal with <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is corrupted, and fifty falſe canons are added to the twenty canons of the ſame Council; and the Jeſuites would hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world, that his Holineſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, which was ſhortened by the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council being

               <p>To this paſs are general Councels come: thoſe of old ſpeak new lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, thoſe of later times teach things contrary to the old: nor are theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

               <p>THat the Metropolitanes of diſtinct Provinces have power to call Councils for reformation of any Schiſms, or deciſion of any Queſtions or Doubts in Religion, it was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Churches: and if the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> have any preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Juriſdiction in order to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, it was but derived from the power of Councels, as I have proved before; and therefore the ſame power giving authority to other Provincials to call Councils, they are not debarred of this priviledge by any Order or Decree of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they not being under her juriſdiction or power (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

               <p>By all and every of which canons it is plain, that one Biſhop ſhould not intermeddle in the Dioceſs of another,

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:121658:141"/>deſire the aſſiſtance of his neighbour-Provincials; which makes by that means a general Council, by calling in the neighbour-Provincials as the cauſe ſhall require: and this is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by theſe Councils for to be lawful ſo to do, without any reſervation to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as if without her Provincial this might not be done) who by the ſixth canon of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> is but equal with <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and <hi>Alexandria, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Rome</hi> and other Provinces, have like priviledges reſerved to them by the expreſs words of that canon.</p>
               <p>This was the practice of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches;

Which council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was not called till 26 yeers after the council of <hi>Nice.</hi> So that for the Doctor to alleadge againſt us (as he doth poſitively in his book, <hi>fol.</hi> 221.) that we cannot call a Council, ſeems ſomething ſtrange to me, to proceed from a Doctor; for it is an argument that he is ignorant of thoſe canons, or elſe if he have read them, thoſe copies he has peruſed are of <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> print, and much vary from the Originals. However, I muſt needs wonder at his harſh cenſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his native country, and his <hi>quondam</hi>-mother-Church, that he ſhould deny her that priviledge and juriſdiction which is not due to her alone, but common to all Provincials,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:121658:142"/>which by the authority of Councels and by the practice of the Primitive, and by the enſamples of later ages, have and do call Provincial Councils within their reſpective territories and precincts, and do there decree Rules of faith to be obſerved of all within the Province, as may appear by theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing preſidents.</p>
               <p>There was a Provincial Council called at <hi>Ancyra</hi> in <hi>Galitia</hi> of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Biſhops;

<note place="margin">Provincial Councels not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Biſhop of Rome.</note> nor any Appeals ought from thoſe Provincials to be made unto him, it being againſt the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the ſeveral Provincials to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of Appeals to him.</p>

For ſhould our Church convene a Synod, ſhe would either reconcile the differences, or condemn them as Hereticks which diſſent from her: and after that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced, they are no more of our Church, though they may be ſaid to be in our Church, according to that of S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Si ex nob is eſſent, permanſerint nobiſcum.</hi> And let me not appear partial in this point, to paſs it over barely thus, without ſhewing the reaſons the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not reform theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, ſith before in this Treatiſe (Chap. 5.)

Let us therefore pray the

               <p>This is the Lords doing thus to viſit her: and would it pleaſe him to ſay to the deſtroying Angel. <hi>It is enough;</hi> would he in mercy turn to his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and have pity on her; would he pleaſe to reſtore her beauty, that ſhe might rejoyce in her ſalvation; and and that the world might no longer laugh to ſee Chriſts diſciples weep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.20: Then I dare on her behalf promiſe, ſhe would not be ſlack to reform the enormities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt Chriſt and his Truth.

                  <hi>by the advice of the Lords ſpiritual and temporal,</hi> &amp;c. it is not hereby to be underſtood that as Spiritual Lords they judged in the making of the Municipal Law; onely they were named before the Temporal Lords, for that they were the greater number, and all Barons or Peers were alike. The Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and Priors which had Baronies annexed to them, were far exceeding the number of the Temporal Lords, as may appear by ancient Rolls: there were 27 Abbots, and 2 Priors, which had Baronies annexed to their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualties; by vertue whereof, both they
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:121658:149"/>and the Biſhops (which likewiſe had Baronies annexed to their Sees) ſate on Parliament in a diſtinct capacity from the Spiritualty, as to the matter of Judicature.</p>
               <p>Now that they were the greater number, appears by this: The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots. Priors, and Biſhops, which held by Barony, were fifty; and there were but few Noble-men of the Laity: there were none or few Earls, but of the Blood Royal,
<note place="margin">Noble-men in England.</note> and therefore to this day they are termed by the Kings Writs, <hi>Conſanguinei noſtri:</hi> in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they were made more common; inſomuch that whereas <hi>Alfred</hi> had divided the Kingdom into Shires, and committed the Government of every Shire, and appointed a Lieutenant to every Shire to govern it, and to rule and controul the outrageous ſubjects at home, as well as to defend it from forraign enemies, That Officer in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times became a Count, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try over which he was appointed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was called a County; which ſince was changed, the King taking from the Earl or Count that power, he not liking that this power ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:121658:149"/>main in one hereditary, and which had it not immediately from himſelf. And becauſe the Earl to whom ſuch charge was committed was not ſo ready to be corrected if he did amiſs, and that the adminiſtration of juſtice might immediately proceed from the King himſelf, it was therefore taken from the Earl, and given to one yeerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereto; who becauſe he did execute that power which the Earl formerly had, is called <hi>Vice-comes, quia vicem Comit is ſuppleat.</hi> Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there were not many Peers of the Laytie.</p>
               <p>And as for any other degrees of Nobility, as Duke, Marqueſs,
<note place="margin">Nobility in England.</note> or Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they were but puiſne names of titular dignity, and doth not make them Peers or Judges of Parliament, unleſs they have Baronies annexed to them, as it is reſolved by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4.7. and therefore in Parliament all Peers votes are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, without diſtinction of their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular dignities.

By which it is manifeſt, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was but few in ancient time; and therefore the Lords Spiritual being the greater number of Peers, are named before the Lords Temporal: not that they either have any ſuperiority in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, or that they ſit there as Judges in their Spiritual capacity, as may likewiſe appear by Roll of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 18 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>m.</hi> 17. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſitting in a Convocation at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> were inhibited to meddle of the Temporal ſtate of the King or his Nobles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon pain of having their Baronies confiſcate: for they had diſtinct capacities: as they are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, they were not to meddle with Temporal affairs, wherefore were they inhibited in that Aſſembly at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> which was meerly of ſpiritual men, to proceed in matters temporal: and as they are Barons, and therefore ſit in Parliament, they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:121658:150"/>may not there judge of things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, all tranſactions of that nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive debate in the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergie. Wherefore it may not be laid to the charge of the Biſhops, that they ſitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not reform the Schiſms in the Church, for that they were not proper Judges thereof as they ſate in Parliament, but onely when they ſate in the Convocation; which Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was prevented to be convened according to the old Rules and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of this Nation by the popular ſort; which then not knowing what they would have, at all adventure cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down Epiſcopacie; and having pulled down that ſtately glorious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, all that ever the then-buſie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers could frame out of the timber of the old building, was but to patch and cobble up a Presbyterian cottage and that ſo weakly joynted and ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that it was judged by the moſt of them that it could not ſtand above three yeers.

               <p>It is an evil bird defiles its own neſt: and muſt our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sion, which was the glory of this Land, and the envie

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I humbly beg of the chief Governours and Rulers of the people, to reflect upon their mother-Church, and to conſider her in her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to pray for her, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her peace: <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall proſper that love her:</hi> And to put to their helping hand to lift up her head out of the duſt, That ſhe may no longer lie groaning and groveling under the heavie hands of wilde perſecutors, but may by the aſſiſtance and loving aid of the Judges of the people, be called upon, that ſhe may either clear her ſelf to the condemnation of her oppoſers, or ſuffer according to her deſerving, by the grave judgement and ſentence of the Wiſe of the Land, and not to be troden down and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured without a fair trial, (any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Now the Lord open the hearts, and give bowels of compaſſion to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the people, that by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the Church may be again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, ſo that we may worſhip God in ſpirit and truth; and that we having again reſtored unto us a <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem at unity within it ſelf,</hi> we may <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</hi> that we may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the brefts of her conſolation; that we may milk out, and be delighted with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her glory; and that by the means of her nurſing fathers, it would pleaſe God to extend peace on her like a flood, that we may ſuck, be born
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:121658:152"/>upon her ſides, and be joyful upon her knees; to the quieting of all differences amongſt us, and to the everlaſting peace of thoſe that wiſh well to <hi>Sion.</hi>

               <p>But I have dwelled too long upon this point: I return to the ſubject matter of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>You may partly perceive that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not altogether to be blamed for the Errors and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in our Land in matters pertaining to Faith and Diſcipline. I dare be bold on her behalf to aſſure the Papiſts ſhe deſires a fair debate of all thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and would willingly reconcile them, or caſt off thoſe that would not hearken to her inſtructions: and might ſhe by the favour and free leave of the Civil Magiſtrate convene, and were encouraged to have his aſſiſtance in order to put in execution her Decrees (without which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatſoever ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves is but like a <hi>Laterane</hi> Junto not obligatory to the Weſtern Princes, nor the people under their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſhe would not be ſparing to launce the wounds of theſe diviſions to the bottom, that, if there were any hopes of amendment, to cauſe ſound
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:121658:152"/>and new fleſh to grow a gain; or elſe, finding them irrecoverable by reaſon ſome are grown deſperately wicked beyond all remedy, to cut off ſuch as withered branches, that they might no longer be a cauſe to putrifie the ſtock and body of the tree: and when ſhe has done, would not be aſhamed of her work, but would recommend it to the publike conſideration of others; which being by them approved, might be exemplary for their imitation; or if by the Divine Rule of Scripture it was to be faulted, then to be by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and receive a juſt condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I dare be bold to ſay, that if any thing ſhould be debated in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, which might not ſeem ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to any other ſiſter-Province ſhe would entertain a free debate with her: and if they two could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the controverſie, ſo far as might be ſatisfactory to others, ſhe would agree to ſubmit the debate to a General Council, might but that Council be free in its conſtitution, and not ſubſervient to one man the Pope; which by the confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmin.

Wherefore ſeeing that this is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:121658:159"/>of our ſalvation, let us onely repair hither to be ſpiritually furniſhed againſt all temptations of Satan; and let us caſt off all other traditions of humane invention, which ſhall declare any other thing then what is contained in theſe Evangelical truths.</p>

And not onely the Saints of <hi>Coloſſus;</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> are enjoyned to this diligence; but all in general, by S. <hi>John</hi> in the place afore-cited.

               <p>S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the golden-mouth'd Doctor, diſcourſeth at large upon this ſubject in ſeveral places of his Works. I ſhall ſhew you two or three. In his Proeme in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he ſaith, If therefore you will read the Scripture with alacrity of minde ye need no other help at all: for Chriſt's Word is true, <hi>Seek and ye ſhall finde,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe many of you are charged with wives, children, and domeſtick affairs, and ſo cannot wholly addict your ſelves to this ſtudy,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:121658:160"/>yet be ready to hear what others have gathered; and beſtow as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in hearing as you do in ſcraping worldly goods together: for the cauſe of your infinite evils is your ignorance in Scripture. So that by his Rule, 1. We need no other help to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 2. All ſorts ſhould ſtudy it. 3. Evil manners, diſſolute life, and all other miſchiefs, proceed of ignorance of the Scriptures, and by not reading of them.</p>
               <p>Again, the ſame <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 29 <hi>Hom.</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. I beſeech you (ſaith he) that you now and then come hither, and attend diligently the reading of the holy Scripture; neither that onely when you come hither, <hi>ſed &amp; domi divina Biblia in manus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, &amp; utilitatem in illis poſitam magno ſtudio ſuſcipite.</hi> Again, the ſame godly and zealous Father in his 9. Hom. upon the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſaith, Hearken, all ye that are encumbered with worldly affairs, and have wives and children, how ye are eſpecially commanded to read the Scriptures: <hi>Comparate vobis Biblia, animae Pharmaca.</hi> If ye will have no other
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:121658:160"/>thing; at leaſt provide ye the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin de tempore, ſerm.</hi> 55. <hi>Nec ſolum vob is ſufficiat quod in Eccleſiis divinas lectiones auditis, ſed etiam in domibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, aut ipſi legite, aut alios le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes requirite, &amp; libenter audite.</hi> And herewith accords S. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the 133 Pſalm, affirming, that in his time both Monks, men, and women, did contend which ſhould learn moſt Scripture without book; <hi>&amp; in co putant eſſe meliores, ſi plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res edicerint.</hi> The Council of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> can. 59. poſitively decrees, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet plebeis legere ſola ſacra volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina veteris &amp; novi Teſtamenti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the invitation by way of perſwaſion, as it is for advantage, it being the means of our ſalvation, and a charge and command by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to ſearch thoſe Scriptures, leſt we fall into evils and miſchiefs, and holy Fathers inſtructing all to follow thoſe Evangelical precepts: whereby it is not preſſed unto us as a thing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency onely, but likewiſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for every one to perform this duty; every one being concerned to read and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:121658:161"/>learn the Scriptures. How much then is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be blamed, that debarreth men of this means of ſalvation? ſhe excommunicating eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that ſhall read the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue. And ſo much are the Papiſts bewitched with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Popes curſes and the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of his bleſſings, that they will not read any thing that is oppoſite to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, not having licenſe ſo to do; and ſo they make Ignorance the mother of their devotion, and that contrary to the practice of the Primitive Church, as appears by the Council.</p>
               <p>As touching this Point,
<note place="margin">Who are to judge of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> Who ſhall be Judge of the Scripture, the Doctor is pleaſed to accuſe our Church of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal errour, becauſe of ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants that hold ſtrange opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter; and yet he cites but an opinion or two of private Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in our Church. So I may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Church from the imputations he herein lays to her charge, as he has elſewhere done in the like caſe. That it is not the opinion and judgement of the Church, but onely the conceptions of thoſe private men. Certainly the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:121658:161"/>Doctor could not be ignorant of our Churches Tenent in this particular: and truely this gives me occaſion to ſuſpect the Doctor is not the Author of that Book called <hi>The Loſt Sheep,</hi> but it was compoſed by ſome one that was leſs knowing of the Doctrines and Tenents of our Church. However, for ſatisfaction of others, I will here ſet down what our Church has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>de fide</hi> in relation to this point.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> teaches, that the Scripture is the onely Judge of Traditions, and Rule of ſalvation; and that it contains all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation: and whatſoever is not contained therein, or may not be proved thereby, is not to be received as an Article of faith, or thought requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But ſhe doth not determine that this Scripture ſhall be interpreted by every mans private fancy: for,
<note place="margin">The things neceſſary to ſalvation are plain, and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</note> to charge her with that, is a known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and contrary to the 6 and 20 Articles of the Church. I confeſs that we generally maintain that thoſe things which are neceſſary to ſalvation
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:121658:162"/>are clear and manifeſt; the whole Scripture being termed <hi>a light unto our feet, and a lanthorn to our ſteps,</hi> Pſal. 139. And if it be hid, it is hid unto them that are loſt, whom the God of this world hath blinded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat the light of the Goſpel of the glory of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould not ſhine unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. For it is plain by the Scripture, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.28. And <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. The Father hath ſent the Son, and his works bear witneſs of him; and the Scriptures teſtifie of him: God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghoſt the Comforter, his Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Ghoſt, being ſo plainly preached and ſet down, that a man may read them running: and this Word endureth for ever, and this Word is preached unto us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25. And <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> and what need we any more? <hi>This is eternal life, to know the Father, and Jeſus
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:121658:162"/>Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Joh. 17.3. He is <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life.</hi> We <hi>believe that thou art Chriſt the Son of the ever-living God,</hi> and <hi>thou haſt the words of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal life, Joh.</hi> 5.68. Hence S. <hi>Auſtin, lib. de doctr. Chriſtianae, cap.</hi> 9. did affirm, that all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to mans ſalvation are plain and eaſie to be underſtood. And <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> upon 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. Hom. 3. <hi>Omnia plana ſunt ſunt e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>x divinis Scripturis, quaecunque neceſſaria ſunt manifeſta ſunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not therefore an idle and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous doctrine in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to maintain this, ſince we have both authority of Scripture and the Fathers for the ſame. Nor do we hereby rob the Church of her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to judge of and determine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and thoſe things that are doubtful in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>There are ſome things of Diſcipline, and pertaining to Manners, in which the Scriptures may be doubtful, or not eaſie for every capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: and for thoſe, it is fit the Church ſhould determine them, and having
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:121658:163"/>determined them, to impoſe them by the Princes authority as Rules of faith upon the people; and ſo teaches the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the twentieth Article.
<note place="margin">Lay-men to read Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> But the main things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our ſalvation, concerning our faith to be grounded upon Jeſus the Son of the ever-living God, the author and finiſher of our faith, thoſe, as I ſaid before, are clear and manifeſt: and though Angels from heaven ſhould teach any other doctrine, they are to be accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſith this is plain and manifeſt in Scripture, that Jeſus gave himſelf for our ſins; and whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and for that this faith is given by the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. and is the gift of God, and no man hath it of himſelf (for fleſh and blood doth not reveal it) and for that Chriſt has preſcribed the way how and by what means we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this gift, even by ſearching the Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10; It muſt needs be a grievous and intolerable ſin in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to debar the people
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:121658:163"/>of this means to attain this precious jewel, the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds do we allow the Laytie to read the Scripture; but we do not hereby give them liberty to interpret it according to their will and humour. They may in them finde Jeſus to be the life everlaſting, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giving them faith; and therefore muſt not be debarred the means. But they are not allowed in points of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to be their own interpreter, but to repair to the Fathers of the Church to declare the meaning of thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, to whom it is given by the power of the holy Ghoſt to know the myſteries of the kingdom of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. For which end, Chriſt has commended the Scriptures to the Church, that ſhe may diſcern, keep, and publiſh them: Chriſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scriptures to his diſciples <hi>Luke</hi> 24. and they preached it to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. calls the Truth the fountain of the Church, and the Church the pillar of Truth: as <hi>Solomon</hi> made his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots to have a golden axletree, and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of ſilver; underſtanding by the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:121658:164"/>axletree (ſays one) ſound doctrine; by the pillars, the faithful teachers of the ſame. The Scripture is the truth of God, and the Church the houſe of God; the Scripture the foundation, the Church the pillar: and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is not ſuſtained by the pillar, but the pillar ſupported of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Truth makes the Church, not the Church the Truth. We are to obſerve the Scripture as it were the Candle, the Church as the Candleſtick; according as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. ſays,
<note place="margin">Church how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret.</note> The Scriptures are not true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church ſays they are the Word of God; but the teſtimony of the Church is true, becauſe they are the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Now as we aſcribe to our Church this priviledge of interpretation of difficult and obſcure places,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scriptures above Councels,</hi>

                     </gap>nte, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</note> we do not either deprive <hi>Rome</hi> of her right, or too much extol our own Church. Nor do we hereby make void the Laytie's reading of Scripture. The Laytie may read it, becauſe the main points are eaſie; and it is the means to obtain faith, as well as by hearing the Church, in thoſe points that are eaſie; and it is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:121658:164"/>the way enjoyned by God to attain faith, as well as by preaching; and he has promiſed his Spirit to thoſe that ſeek him earneſtly, and with unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lips. And when it ſhall pleaſe God by their reading to give them of his holy Spirit, that Spirit will guide them to come to the Church, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in thoſe things they underſtand not; or ſhall the Church underſtand that through weakneſs they miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any point in thoſe Scriptures, and ſhe ſhall reprove them, the ſame Spirit guiding them into the way of Truth, will lead them to hearken to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the ſacred Oracles. And if the Church ſhall deliver any thing which to other Churches may ſeem ſtrange, and not ſatisfactory; ſhe, as I ſaid before in the precedent Chapter, will call a Synod; and if there the buſineſs receive not an abſolute and ſatisfactory reſolution, to ſubmit the buſineſs to a General Council rightly conſtituted, and free in it ſelf. And in the mean time, if our Church offend the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that ſhe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from her in any particular; let her make her ſelf capable to reform by a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:121658:165"/>General Councel, by taking off the ſlavery that lies upon it by the Popes Canonical Law, and we ſhall ſubmit our Church to the free debate in a perfect Council to decide the points wherein we differ; (otherwiſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might ſeem to have juſt cauſe to accuſe us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that we caſt off the diſcipline of the Primitive Churches as to that particular:) but in the mean time, upon the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited texts of Scripture, upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Fathers, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of former ages, we ſhall perſiſt to affirm, That the Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to ſalvation, That thoſe points neceſſary are plain and eaſie, and That the Laytie may read the Scriptures. And for any blemiſhes which the Doctor would in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular have thrown upon our Church, I hope it is but duſt thrown againſt the winde, and is flown back into his own eyes. I wiſh the Scriptures received no more injury by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then it doth from our Church: but that is manifeſt to the contrary, as may appear by that which here next follows.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:121658:165"/>
               <p>The Doctor in his Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 229.
<note place="margin">Scriptures abuſed by the Church of Rome.</note> reckons up a great number of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and errours crept into our Tranſlations, but named not any; onely cites one <hi>Broughton</hi> for his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. I muſt confeſs it was wiſely put off: for ſhould he have named them, they would have appeared to have been different from the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Tranſlation, but not diſſonant from the ancient Copies; and ſo he would, in ſtead of faulting ours, have cenſured their own Tranſlations. Yet he craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily imagining that thoſe 848 cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted places ſhould be believed to be ſo, if he could inſtance any, he names four in his 22 Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Anſwer to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlations we are tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</note> He brings in <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Luthers</hi> Tranſlations, adding the word <hi>onely</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. And this he would have to be an errour of our Church. He might as well tax <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for this fault: for the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not adde that word in her Bibles which are printed by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by direction of the Church enjoyned to be read: nor is the word to be found in <hi>Fulk</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> thoſe two quarrellers each with other.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:121658:166"/>Wherefore I muſt needs wonder that the Doctor ſhould be ſo injurious to us, to bring falſe accuſations againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond place which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor alleadges to be a miſ-tranſlation in our Bibles, is 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Giving diligence (by good works) to make your calling and election ſure:</hi> He charges us with corruption, for leaving out theſe words, <hi>by good works.</hi> This I muſt confeſs is different from the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Tranſlation: but I rather ſuſpect that that Tranſlation is to be faulted, not ours: for <hi>Rome,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her doctrine of Merits (by which ſhe cozens poor ſilly ſouls, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich her Clergie, cheats them of what they have) has added theſe words. And I am the rather induced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, for that I have ſeen an ancienter Bible then the days of <hi>Luther,</hi> and it has them not in: and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Tranſlation has them not in. So that as the Negro's blame all that's white in others, becauſe nothing to them is more comely then their own tawny black; ſo the Doctor quarrels againſt our Tranſlation, becauſe of its inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:121658:166"/>it is not beſmeared with <hi>Romes</hi> new adulterate alterations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not in faſhion, or to be approved; and upon this ſcore I may ſay the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor was modeſt that taxed us with no more then four. For he might as well have named the 848. if all muſt be cenſured for corruptions wherein we differ from the Rhemiſh tranſlations. But let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> remember Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 13.5. <hi>Prove your ſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the faith.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. beat down his body and put it ſubjection, leſt while he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others, he himſelf might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Wherefore let <hi>Rome</hi> examine the ancient Copies, and try if ſhe find thoſe words there; and till then, let her forbear to tax us of error, who in this follow antiquity; and ſo upon the old rule, <hi>Id verum eſt quod prius; id adulterum quod poſterius, Tertul. adverſus prax. in prim. part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third errour he taxes us with, is, In putting <hi>and</hi> for <hi>or</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. which he himſelf, to excuſe <hi>Rome</hi> of perverting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe being taxed in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:121658:167"/>in another place, ſhe putting <hi>or</hi> for <hi>and,</hi> and thereby to prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind, affirms that <hi>et</hi> is often rendred <hi>or;</hi> and if ſo, it may as well be taken ſo out of the Engliſh as out of any other tongue. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the reader to a fuller anſwer of this objection in the ſixteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth objection is the 15 verſe of the 2 of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>I will do my diligence you to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in remembrance after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe.</hi> The Engliſh tranſlation reads it thus, <hi>I will endeavor that you may be able after my deceaſe to have theſe things in remembrance.</hi> For this we likewiſe appeal to any tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was before the ſecond councel of <hi>Nice:</hi> and many of their own tranſlators long after that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel did render it <hi>poſt exitum, non poſt obitum. Peter</hi> being to go to his See at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> writes to the Saints that dwell in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> that after his departure they ſhould ſtrive to have in memory to make their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Election ſure; of which in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:121658:167"/>the 12 verſe he ſays, <hi>He would not be negligent to put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> Now how can this be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, that after his deceaſe he ſhould put them in remembrance, unleſs he ſhould come againe unto them? it muſt therefore be interpreted of his departing from amongſt them to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and that he would ſend to them to put them in mind, knowing that his end drew neer, when he could not; and therfore, ſays the text, <hi>he would uſe all diligence to put them in mind.</hi> Now how he ſhould put them in mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe, is to expect that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall not reſt from his labors, as if he were not dead in the Lord, which is unchriſtian to think: wherefore I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this to the learned in the Hebrew tongue, to illuſtrate this further to weaker capacities, if there be any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſcruple in our tranſlation, which for my part I conceive, that, taking that verſe with the ſenſe of the former, our tranſlation is more genuine and carries more of integrity then that of <hi>Rhemes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> having by the politick practices of their predeceſſors,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:121658:168"/>and by the unworthy complottings of the Cardinals (who being in hopes to aſcend the Papal Throne themſelves care not what dominion and Lordſhip they aſcribe unto the Pontifical ſeat) gained a ſuperiority over Kings and Councels, controlling the one and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the other as they pleaſe, did daily conſult not only how to preſerve what they have (though their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be utterly unjuſt) but likewiſe continually ſtudy to enlarge (if poſſible) this their pomp and dignity. For their ambitious minds not ſatisfied with theſe large acquiſitions, thinking them but an earthly ſoveraignty, &amp; too narrow for their large ſouls to ſtrut in, they would perſwade the world that the Pope is an angel or more, and hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from heaven, and is ſent from thence to poſſeſs the chaire, and <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam à Tripode</hi> to deliver new ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles upon earth.</p>

Now becauſe thoſe their traditions were uncertaine, the ſects of the Phariſees ſprung up, and <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> obtruding new traditions as ſimply neceſſary and a more perfect Rule of Sanctity then that that was writ: whereupon our Saviour in the ſeventh of <hi>Mark</hi> reproves them, ſaying, They worſhip me in vaine, teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men; and yet in the 23 of <hi>Mat.</hi> he hath commanded us, ſaying, All that they bid you obſerve, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do; but after their works do not: for they ſay, and do not.</p>
               <p>Theſe two texts ſeem to impugne each other: but the fathers of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church have reſolved this knot, and reconciled theſe texts, by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:

And herewith agreeth <hi>Bellarmine, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. ſaying That the books of the Prophets and Apoſtles are the true word of God, and the ſure and true rule of our faith. And as I ſaid before in the precedent Chapter, All things neceſſary to our ſalvation are contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. It is true indeed, that in the Scriptures we do not finde any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Peter</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or of the Aſſumption of <hi>Mary</hi> the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:121658:175"/>mother of Jeſus: nor can we finde by Scriptures, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was a Painter, or that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had ſo much skill in <hi>Appelles</hi> Art, that he drew that exquiſite picture of Chriſt (which <hi>Rome</hi> has) repreſenting unto us his poſture whilſt the Jews whipt him. I muſt confeſs that for theſe matters of importance, we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the traditions of <hi>Rome.</hi> But all things touching God, and the means to attaine faith in him, are plentifully therein to be found.</p>

               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe might perſwade the world of <hi>Peters</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which ſhe would derive all her power, and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, doth therefore teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this tradition under paine of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema That Jeſus met <hi>Peter</hi> as he was, going out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſteps of their feet as they two ſtood talking, have left an impreſſion in the place, which remaines to this day. Now let a man examine the Scriptures, and he ſhall find Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt this tradition, in the third of the <hi>Act.</hi> 21. where he ſays, That Chriſt aſcended, and the heavens ſhall containe him till he come; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is called his ſecond coming to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:121658:178"/>Judgement, according to the Article of the Apoſtles Creed: and therefore that he ſhould be bodily there with <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo bodily as to leave the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his footſteeps, is againſt Saint <hi>Peters</hi> own ſaying, againſt the whole current of the Scriptures, and againſt the Apoſtles Creed. So I referr this to the Reader, whether to believe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, or his pretended ſucceſſor, in this point.</p>
               <p>It may be that <hi>Peter</hi> might ſee Chriſt in a viſion as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. but not bodily, for that he is there in heaven, whom the heavens muſt containe till all things be diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Another tradition the church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, How that in the Church of the Fryers minors at <hi>Rome,</hi> is a picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> drawn by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> carrying in proceſſion in the time of a Plague, the Plague ceaſed; and they taught the people that it was by our Ladyes meanes, for the honor done to her Image; and ſo aſcribe that to her, which is due unto the Lord God, he correcting by Judgements, and out of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:121658:179"/>his goodneſs extending his mercy as ſeems beſt to his divine wiſdome: and hereby they neglect that duty God has enjoyned them, in that they did flye to the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> for ſuccor in that day of their viſitation, whenas God has commanded them to call upon him in the day of trouble, and he will hear them.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts likewiſe teach, that in the Church of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> an Angel appeared to Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> as he was ſaying Maſs at the Altar of Saint <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and ſaid to him theſe words, In this place there is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſins, brightneſs and light everlaſting, joy and gladneſs without end. And this favours of Atheiſme, to affirme, that on earth there can be light everlaſting, as if the world ſhould never have an end, which is contrary to Scripture, for that they plainly affirm an utter diſſolution of all things 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> witneſſes, How that at the end of the world, the Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon and the Stars ſhall loſe their light, the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and the powers
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:121658:179"/>of the Heavens ſhall be ſhaken. They likewiſe teach, that in the Church of <hi>Calixius,</hi> is the Altar whereon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid Maſs; which is not prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in reſpect he never mentions it in Scripture; nor Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that ever he uſed any ſuch thing; beſides, the ſacrifice of the Altar is againſt the Scripture, as may appear in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> likewiſe teaches, that in the Church of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> the Lateran in <hi>Rome,</hi> is a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel called the <hi>Sacriſts,</hi> wherein is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſins, both <hi>à poena &amp; culpa;</hi> and that not far from the ſame Chappel is an aſcent of thirty two ſteps, which were the ſame Chriſt went up when he went before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and were brought from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> thither; and that whoſoever aſcends thoſe ſteps, for every ſtep he hath a hundred yeers of pardon: which is contrary to the Scriptures. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21.

He is the Miniſter of God to take vengeance on them that do evil.

And none ſhould ſay unto them, What doſt thou?</p>
               <p>As for Prieſts, it is plain by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that thoſe under the Law were
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:121658:183"/>to offer ſacrifice for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

Gods Covenant with them was of life &amp; peace, and that their lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, <hi>Malach.</hi> 2.4. And the Prieſts under the Goſpel are a holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. For Kings and all that be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: and <hi>Peter</hi> the prime Apoſtle was commanded to follow Chriſt, who left him an example of ſuffering and obedience; which S. <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf witneſſes to the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. For hereunto are ye called: for Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an enſample that yee ſhould follow his ſteps. From all which places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may be deduced theſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Kings are repreſentatives of God the Father; to them is given all power and dominion to rule and command: Prieſts are the lively Images of Chriſt, to whom he has left his precept of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, to be obedient and ſerve. To Kings is left authority to puniſh evil
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:121658:183"/>doers; to Prieſts, to pray for all men, even their own oppreſſors; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence evil for evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. Kings are to uſe the material ſword for vengeance; Prieſts the ſpiritual ſword the Word to make ſupplication for all Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. Kings are not to be rebuked; Prieſts are to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with patience. Kings ſit in Gods throne; Prieſts ſerve at his Altar. Kings are Angels of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.20. Prieſts are the Embaſſadors of Chriſt, beſeeching us in Chriſts ſtead to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God.</p>
               <p>Yet Kings, though they be thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and ſuperintendent over all, they have an eſpecial charge to reſpect the Prieſts, and hearken unto them, <hi>Num.</hi> 27.21. And it is the duty of Prieſts to reverence them, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13. Prieſts pay their tribute of obedience, and duty; but Kings are to recompence it with reſpect and love. The power of the Prieſt over the people ceaſed, when <hi>Saul</hi> was King; and yet <hi>Saul</hi> was to hearken to <hi>Samuel.</hi> The Majeſty of the one muſt not deſpiſe the humility of the other: the King, as I ſaid, is the Miniſter of Juſtice, the Prieſts the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:121658:184"/>Meſſengers of Mercy. Theſe two muſt not claſh againſt each other, but with Princely <hi>David,</hi> ought with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious concurrence of ſpirit to <hi>ſing of mercy and judgement; mercy and truth</hi> to <hi>meet together, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and peace</hi> to <hi>kiſs each other.</hi> For as there is a <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> for the one. <hi>Touch not mine anointed;</hi> ſo there is a precept of preſervation for the other, <hi>Do my prophets no harm.</hi> There is a general tye laid upon all, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers;</hi> wherein the Miniſters of the Goſpel are included: and likewiſe there is a rule of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence preſcribed to all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>Obey them that have the overſight of you, for that they watch for your ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. wherein Princes are not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which ſhews, that Princes are to hearken to their word and doctrine, and to be courteous to them, and not to <hi>grieve the holy Spirit of God.</hi> Eph. 4. and they are to be obedient to Princes, for that <hi>they bear not the ſword in vain.</hi> So that theſe two ſeem to have a mutual dependencie each on other: the Prieſt muſt exhort
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:121658:184"/>with ſound doctrine, to which obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt be given upon paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and the King may enjoyn the practice of that or any other rule of faith agreeable to the word of God, which the Biſhop likewiſe upon the ſame paine is bound to obſerve: onely here is the difference; in point of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance betwixt King and Prieſt, the King is above the Prieſt to execute Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Prieſt being bound to obey not to rule; which is no confuſion of the Eccleſiaſtical eſtate, they being hereunto ordained to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, when it ſhall pleaſe God, for their ſins, or the ſins of the people, to ſet an ungodly man to be ruler over them; Againſt whom ſhould they out of the dictates of humane reaſon exalt themſelves, for that they fleſhlily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that otherwiſe the Church of Chriſt will be utterly deſtroyed, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues their infidelity of Chriſts promiſe to his Church, which ſhal never be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally inviſible: and he having enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them obedience, they muſt ſubmit unto that rule, and rely upon Gods providence to his Church, who can (contrary to humane reaſon)
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:121658:185"/>make the blood of the Martyrs the ſeed of the Church: Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> have left theſe commendations to the Saints of the ſeveral Churches, To ſuffer is the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye if ye ſuffer for well doing: and Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.

This was the practiſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Apoſtles: and that the Pope is bound hereunto, I ſhall make it evident by the examples both of the old and new Teſtaments, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the ancient and moderne practiſes of all Chriſtian ſtates.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuites,
<note place="margin">Biſhops not above Kings.</note> thoſe ſtiff maintainers of the Popes prerogative, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to beguile the world with their ſubtil ſophiſtry, that they might by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:121658:185"/>any means ſet up his holineſs above all powers on earth; and therefore they would perſwade that Church-men are as far above Kings, as the ſoul is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the body; and that Kings ſhould be ſubject to them, in reſpect their power is from the people, the Biſhops power is from God: and if Churchmen obey Princes, it is out of diſcretion, for order ſake, not out of neceſſity of obedience. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That the people deſired a King, tis true, and they had one given them; but his power is from above, and he was by appointment of God anointed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. and after that the people had ſubmitted themſelves to the King, they could not caſt him off. <hi>Samuel</hi> told them by way of premonition, that he ſhould rule over them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding their ſons, ſervants, fields, ſheep <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you ſhall cry out in that day, as thinking your ſelves op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed but the Lord will not hear you, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. For his power once veſted, it is from above by which he holds it: he is <hi>

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:121658:186"/>he be ſaid to derive his power from men, for that he is choſen by his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and formerly was nominated by the Emperors, as I have ſhewed you in the fourth Chapter: ſo that the Kings deriving their power from the people, as in reference to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular exerciſing of the Kingly power, doth not prove their power from the people; their power is from God, though the people deſire this or that prince to be over them: and therefore as their power is from God, it is at feaſt equal with the Biſhop <hi>in ſide</hi> to the derivation of the power; and if it were no more but ſo, the Biſhop cannot be above Kingſhip: for <hi>par in par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now that I may further illuſtrate the truth of this point, I will borrow that Objection; and prove by that Reaſon of Kings having their power from the people, that the Pope hath no power to dethrone them.</p>
               <p>That Monarchy and Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie have their riſe from conſent of People, is a truth moſt clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. It is true, that Kingſhip was anciently upon the earth. <hi>Nimrod,</hi>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:121658:186"/>the ſon of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ham,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> was King of <hi>Babel, Gen.</hi> 10. and the Egyptians had a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> over them, ſix hundred yeers before <hi>Saul.</hi> Whereupon, ſome have from hence conceived Kings to be <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> which Aſſertion of theirs admits of this diſtinction: they may be ſaid <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their power, becauſe, <hi>By</hi> God <hi>Kings reign;</hi> they are the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals which go in and out before the people; and it being the Lord of hoſts which gives victory in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, their power is from God. But they are <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> in reference to their Inſtitution, the People onely having a power of choice, whether ſuch a particular man ſhall be ſet over them, ſo rule them, and to go in and out before them.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any thing but reaſon,
<note place="margin">Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their power from the people.</note> that the People had this power from the beginning. For as the King was to have command over their perſons, ſons, and ſervants; ſo it was nothing but right, that the people ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and allow, or diſallow of the particular man, that ſhould have that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:121658:187"/>particular power over them. Hence was it that <hi>Saul,</hi> though anointed of <hi>Samuel</hi> by ſpecial appointment of God, yet by that conſignement he was not abſolute King, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained to be Governour over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. For that anointing of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> did not give him power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his kingly Office, till <hi>Samuel</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the people in <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. and by conſent of the Tribes was the lot caſt, which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin:</hi> and verſ. 24. <hi>All the people ſhouted, and ſaid, God ſave the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>David</hi> was anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. yet after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death, he was not King, till the men of <hi>Judah</hi> came and anointed him over <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 Sam. 2. And though <hi>David</hi> ſware unto <hi>Bathſheba</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> her ſon ſhould ſucceed him; yet it was the people came and confirmed it, ſaying, <hi>God ſave king Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 1. And <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> his ſon ſucceeded him; but it is plain, he was not king by deſcent, but by the peoples making him ſo: for, ſays the text, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.1. <hi>All
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:121658:187"/>Iſrael were come to Shechem to make him king.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not by inherent right, that the ſons commonly ſucceeded the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Regal Throne, as may appear by that, and the example of <hi>Joaſh;</hi> who being ſon and heir of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> 2 King. 11. yet was he made king by the people; they crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and <hi>clapped their hands, ſaying, God ſave the king.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as theſe Kings. ſo the Romane Emperours, and indeed, all other kings derive their power of governing from the people, not from any Birth-right; not as Heirs ſucceeding in right of Blood, but onely receiving their power from the choice and conſent of the people; which people would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make choice of ſuch heirs, and crown them kings; with <hi>Solomon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting <hi>their land bleſſed, when their king was the ſon of nobles, Eccles</hi> 10.17.

Wherefore, if they ſubmitted themſelves under Abſolute Kings, as the kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> or the Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. thoſe kings

               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> records, how that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> (two Heathens) had an Apophthegm, That <hi>children were to be mockt with toys, and men with oathes.</hi> But I hope Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will hearken to the holy Ghoſt, which both by the mouth of <hi>Moſes</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their promiſes, as in the ſight of the Lord. <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.3. commands that he that makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhould not break it, but <hi>do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that proceeds out of his mouth:</hi> for it is (ſaith one) <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum animae;</hi> according to that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3.15. <hi>Though it be but a mans covenant, yet when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate it, or addes any thing thereto.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people having by ſtipulation

               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Kings bound.</note> As by that ſtipulation the People are bound to ſubmit to the will of that Abſolute Monarch; ſo on the other ſide, if between the King and the People (when the King is appointed over them by their crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and acclamations of <hi>Vive le Roy</hi>) it be conditioned and agreed, that ſuch a king ſhall be over them, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſubject to ſuch and ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; the king is bound to perform thoſe unto them; for it's his Covenant, and the people are onely bound by the pledge of their faith to obey him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe terms, and not elſe. And therefore if ſuch a king on his part break his conditions with ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they may (having power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene a Dyet or Parliament, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement and determination of ſuch Aſſembly not depending upon the will of the Prince) depoſe ſuch a king, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:121658:190"/>proceed to a new election: and this I conceive (with ſubmiſſion to better judgements) is not againſt any texts of Scripture; for that obedience ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally enjoyned to kings in Scripture, is meant of abſolute Kings, to whom the people having ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could upon no terms diſclaim their ſubjection to them: however every one ſtands bound, for conſcience ſake, to any qualified Monarch, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably, according to the condition of his ſtipulation, to be obedient to him.</p>
               <p>As the power of Kings is meerly from this ſtipulation with the People who put themſelves in ſubjection to ſuch a mans government;
<note place="margin">None bound to obey, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as promiſe to obey.</note> ſo this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual perſonal Contract, as it ſhall not extend to the heirs of the king, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the heir of the party promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>That it doth not extend to the heir of the king, is manifeſt, becauſe of the perſonal confidence of the peopole in ſuch an one, to go in and out before them and to be over them; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe of their perſonal promiſe onely to that king: which promiſe, if
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:121658:190"/>it had extended to the heir, the people needed not to have met at <hi>Shechem</hi> to make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſon of <hi>Solomon</hi> king. And in all countries and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms the people meet and crown their new king, for that he perſonally is to govern them, and they perſonally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him: which obedience, had it grown from the faith pledged to the old king, it had been needleſs to have had a meeting to make a new king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt confeſs, that <hi>quilibet poteſt renunciare juri per ſe introducto;</hi> the people may make a Covenant to be obedient to ſuch a King and his heir; and his heir, by vertue of that Covenant, ſhall be over them: and according to the connditions of that ſtipulation, both ſuch heir as king and ſuch people engaged as ſubjects, are indiſpenſably bound. But yet ſuch ſtipulation to obey the heir of the king, doth not binde the heir of the party promiſing; for that, as I ſaid before, the power of governing the people is derived from their voluntary ſubjection to be under that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which ſubjection is perſonal and bins no further then the party promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:121658:191"/>
               <p>It is true, that ſuch were the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> that by the promiſe of the people their ſons and ſervants were bound; that being foretold them by <hi>Samuel;</hi> and ſo they condeſcending unto it, it becomes, <hi>de modo conceſſionis,</hi> due and to be obeyed. And thus it was with the Jews under the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; in which reſpect, all the Land of Jewry was bound, it being taxed under <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar.</hi> Luk. 2. and this being generally proclaimed and known, and the ſons and ſervants not gainſaying it, they (as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by their parents and maſters) are likewiſe bound to this obedience, though not perſonally promiſing the ſame. But generally in all other Countries, the Covenant between the king and the people is ſo perſonal that it is onely reſtrained to the parties ſo promiſing, and no further. For were the ſon to obey by reaſon of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers promiſe, it were needleſs to have the fealty of the ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore was it, that in <hi>England</hi> there was a view of <hi>Frank-Pledge,</hi> where every man of twelve
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:121658:191"/>yeers of age ſhall take the Oath of Allegaince: and it is declared that every one (21 <hi>E.</hi> 3.12.) ought to be attendant to ſome view of <hi>Frank-pledge</hi> or other, to take an Oath to be true and faithful to the King. Which was a very politick conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, ſhould any difference after ariſe between the king and people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his miſ-government, none ſhould judge thereof, but ſuch as ſtood bound by Oath to obey the king according to the Laws; whereby the king might be confident the people would not wrongfully tax the king leſt they ſhould pull Perjury upon themſelves; and the king was likewiſe hereby to take heed, that he did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to that Law, leſt the ſucceeding generations would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to have him over them and for that without their voluntary and perſonal conſents, they were not thereunto bound.</p>
               <p>As for the term of Natural Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<note place="margin">Natural Allegiance conſidered.</note> it is in reſpect of a mans being born of parents which have right and priviledge in the Laws of the Nation and Country of which they are, for

For thoſe Laws proceeding from the people of ſuch Nation or Country, and being by king and people confirmed to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are onely proper to the natural people of ſuch Nation or Country; which Laws are to be a guide to ſuch people: and for that they are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in point of protection to the off-ſpring of ſuch people, ſuch off-ſpring is ſaid a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> natural ſubject, as having birth-right to thoſe Laws which are to protect and govern them. For as they are onely to receive correction from the Rule of that Law, they may more properly be ſaid local ſubjects then natural; every ſtranger being with them, in that reſpect, during reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſuch Nation or Country, equally obnoxious to them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being onely born of natural pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of that Country, they are ſaid natural ſubjects to that Law.
<note place="margin">Natural Allegiance.</note> For as to the perſonal ſubjection of any man to be governed by ſuch a king of that Country, he is not by naturality abſolutely concluded under that power
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:121658:192"/>before a perſonal engagement; onely it is a perſwaſive motive to make him ſubject himſelf to ſuch a king or power, but no poſitive tye; the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that thereby accrues to king and people, onely ariſing upon the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtipulation, perſonally condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and agreed upon by king and people.</p>
               <p>Sith then it is plain, that kings are by the people inſtituted into their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal power, whether abſolute (and ſo upon no terms to be queſtioned by the people engaged, God onely being to puniſh ſuch for their miſ-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by raiſing ſome ſtrange power to ſcourge them when and as he pleaſes) or qualified; and ſo to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles of Stipulation. The Pope upon no terms is to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle to depoſe them: for after they are once inveſted in this power over the people, whether Abſolute or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, yet whilſt they are ſo over the people, and to go in and out before the people, their power is from God, by whom they reign, and therefore not to be queſtioned by his Holineſs, who is neither the party without which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:121658:193"/>they were not ſet up, nor yet having any authority above their power.</p>
               <p>And ſhould any Prince or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate once acquire this Regal power from the alacrity and free conſent of people, and afterwards ſubmit that right to the Pope's will; I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm he betrays the peoples intereſt to a ſtranger, and is utterly injurious to his own Crown; for that he being once inveſted in the Regal Throne, is by Gods power and authority to go in and out before the people: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this power under ſo heavenly a Maſter, he muſt not become tenant at will to the Pope, who is belowe him as to queſtion his Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Bellarmine, de Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. would exalt Biſhops above Kings, for that they adminiſter Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Kings onely adminiſter Juſtice in Civil matters; that doth not ſubject Kingſhip to Epiſcopacie: for the credit of the Biſhops actions muſt ſerve the glory of God, not the Biſhop onely; the ſpiritual work is of God, the bodily ſervice is of the Miniſter. Now the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:121658:193"/>honour that is to be given him, is in reſpect of his Officiating, not his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and in his reſpect, every man in his own Trade or Calling may be ſaid excellent before the King. The Biſhop is a better Biſhop then the King, but the King is a more excellent man then the Biſhop. The honour due to the King is in reſpect of his perſon: <hi>Who ſhall lift his hand againſt the Lords anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> 1 Sam. 26.9. His perſon is ſacred, and above the reach of Violence: his hand bears the Sword, and the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is annexed to his perſon. But the honour and reſpect to be given to the Biſhops, is in reſpect of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial function: as they are men they are ſubject; and as they are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or ſucceſſors to the Apoſtles, which Office let it in it ſelf be more noble and to be honoured for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>'s reaſon, yet if they rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſacred Oracles of Truth, they muſt by that not onely teach others, but convince themſelves that they are to obey the Civil Magiſtracie; not out of conveniencie, for order ſake; but out of neceſſity, for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:121658:194"/>
               <p>Chriſt ordained both Powers: Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to rule the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and Kings to rule the men, and to guide and diſpoſe Temporal affairs: though, both have Government an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, yet that of Kings is in his own right; that of Biſhops, in Chriſts ſtead to perſwade to rules of Faith and Diſcipline, not to compel: the power of the one is Abſolute; of the other, but Effective: the one may compel, the other onely perſwade.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. The weapons of Biſhops are ſpiritual, thoſe of Kings material: Biſhops are to admoniſh, reprove, and exhort; Kings are to reſtrain the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, by loſs of life, limbs, eſtate, or liberty: the King is to be converſant about holy things, not in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring and execution thereof, as was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> but in appointing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them, as was <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and is to overlook the Biſhops in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the ſpiritual Function. He is to make Laws, and he is to ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of thoſe Laws; and therefore he is to look into the converſation of the Biſhops, that they walk according
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:121658:194"/>to thoſe Laws, otherwiſe to puniſh them.</p>
               <p>But if the King be given over to hardneſs of heart, and will not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the voice of his Prieſts, calling unto him in truth and ſincerity; yet, where he is an abſolute Prince, he is not to be called to an account by them, or the people who have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to be governed by him; but, in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Preces &amp; lachrymae ſunt arma Eccleſiae,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> witneſſes, in his <hi>Orat. contr.

And this was the practice of the Prieſts under the Law, and according to Chriſt's own practice whilſt he was upon the earth, and according to the precepts he left to his Apoſtles for them to walk by, and according to the Rules of thoſe Apoſtles preſcribed to others as examples for their imitation, and according to the ancient practice of the Primitive Church. So that for the Pope upon any pretence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne Kings, is not warrantable, but utterly againſt all truth recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by theſe faithful witneſſes.</p>

And therefore when any thing of Papal intereſt is to be paſſed by Councel, this place is ever pitched upon, as moſt convenient, for that his Holineſs is at hand either with fair means to allure, or with threats to force the oppoſers to condeſcend to his deſires.

               <p>Now theſe things conſidered, I leave it to the Reader, whether to give credit to that Councel, or the Councel of <hi>Mentz,</hi> which depoſed all the Clergie which joyned with <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> it being an unwarrantable act

And ſith there is no warrant from Scripture for the decree of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, or the opinion of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> I hope there is no judicious Chriſtian but will adhere to that of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and not in his judgement approve of the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councel, which was of more <hi>puiſne</hi> time, and ſtrave in all things to pleaſe the Pope: and that the rather, becauſe <hi>Otho Friſigenſis, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. and <hi>Vincentius,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others concurred with <hi>Sigebert,</hi> and the Councel of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in this opinion; whoſe reſolutions in this point are grounded on Gods Word, but the Decree of <hi>Laterane</hi> on mans will, and therefore none may ſubmit his judgement to be deluded with the erroneous and unwarranted decrees thereof.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuites therefore thinking this

As for example: They would prove by the examples of <hi>Saul, Jeroboam, Joaſh, Athaliah,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> being put from their kingdom by the High-Prieſts, to be a warrant for the Popes dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of what Prince he pleaſeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wicked. Whenas thoſe preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents rightly underſtood, make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Popes pretended power herein, but rather againſt him.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Saul,</hi> he was not caſt out by <hi>Samuel; Samuel</hi> onely denounced Gods will, (which was to him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, how that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be caſt from his kingdom) and he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by divine appointment anoint <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his ſteed. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it appears by the Scripture, that although <hi>Saul</hi> ſtood excommunicate,

And whereas <hi>Azariah</hi> was ſhut from men, being a leper, and his ſon <hi>Jotham</hi> ſet up to rule in his ſtead; this doth not prove that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (which the Jeſuites would perſwade to be the figure of the ſpiritual leper) doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne a King: <hi>Azariah</hi> continued King till his death: he was called King in the 22 yeer of his Raign, which was the laſt yeer of his Raign, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 15. So that <hi>Jotham</hi> was not King, but Vice-gerent, during his fathers le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie; and then, his father dying, he claimed an abſolute power in his own right, not by vertue of his fathers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. And whereas <hi>Athaliah</hi> was
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:121658:199"/>deprived of her kingdom by <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, that was by vertue of <hi>Joaſh</hi> whom the Prieſt preſerved in the Temple, he being the right heir, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> an Uſurper, and murderer of old <hi>Azariahs</hi> children, onely <hi>Joaſh</hi> eſcaped her bloody treachery; and after that, the people did adhere to make <hi>Joaſh</hi> their king, and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to put themſelves under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: whereupon, the high-Prieſt did command <hi>Athaliah</hi> the uſurper to be put from the throne, for that <hi>Joaſh</hi> was both heir in blood, and had the general approbation of the people. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. They <hi>clapped their hands, and ſaid, God ſave the king.</hi> And for <hi>Elijahs</hi> withſtanding King <hi>Ahab,</hi> it was becauſe of his <hi>Baalitiſh</hi> Prophets, whom by a miracle he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to <hi>Ahab</hi> to be the cauſe of the famine and the drought, which he ſhewed by prayer for rain: and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> being herewith convinced, gave conſent that the <hi>Baaliteſh</hi> Prieſts ſhould be delivered up; which, by conſent of the people, by a publike Decree were put to death by <hi>Elijahs</hi> hands.</p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:121658:200"/>
               <p>But none of theſe examples do prove that Prieſts have a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings; though the contrary may be proved that Kings depoſed Prieſts, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew <hi>Abimelech</hi> for taking part with <hi>David, Joaſh</hi> commanded <hi>Jehoiadahs</hi> ſons to be put to death, and <hi>Solomon</hi> diſplaced <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high-Prieſt from his primacy and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for following <hi>Adonijahs</hi> faction. The Scripture recites nineteen Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and fourteen of <hi>Judah,</hi> who brake the Covenant made with the Lord, and followed ſtrange gods, and drave the people to apoſtacie; yet was not one of them depoſed by a Prieſt or a Prophet; for they knew that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now as there can be no proof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Old Teſtament, ſo much leſs from the New; but poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly to the contrary, Chriſt himſelf commanding tribute to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers:</hi> and

By all which texts of Scripture it is plain, that Miniſters of the Goſpel, and ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, pray for, but not oppoſe kings; neither are they to look after worldly power and lordſhip, Chriſt himſelf denying to meddle with the dividing of the land betwixt the two brethren <hi>Luke</hi> 12. For this was <hi>praeter</hi> his buſineſs he came about.</p>
               <p>Now if the Pope would be thought to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, let him follow <hi>Peters</hi> precept; and let him imitate Chriſt, who commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> him: let him do his Maſters buſineſs. Let him never think to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle

               <p>When Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The power of the keys doth not warrant the Popes depoſing of Kings.</note> 
                  <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth ſhall be bound in heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven,</hi> He did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give him power to pull down kings, for that after he enjoyned <hi>Ceſars</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:121658:201"/>and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf after ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and taught rules of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Nor was this power given to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, of binding and looſing, but to the reſt of the Apoſtles alſo: <hi>John, James, Bartholomew,</hi> &amp;c. had the like power, as I have ſhewed in the ſecond Chapter. And admit Kings be ſo included under the power of the Keys, yet that doth not prove any power in the Prieſt to dethrone him, onely to denounce Gods judgements againſt his ſin, and to admoniſh him, and to pray for him; but he muſt not meddle with his Temporal Regiment, nor ſo far extend his Eccleſiaſtical power, as to diſ-engage Subjects from their Allegiance to ſuch a Prince: for that is againſt the practice of the Apoſtles, and againſt the precepts of Chriſt. And certainly, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or <hi>Peter</hi> had had any ſuch power by vertue of the Keys, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſuffered it to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, without giving teſtimony to the world of the injury done unto them: <hi>Peter,</hi> if he ſuffered at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> whom all ſtories agree to have ſuffered under <hi>Domitius Nero</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:121658:202"/>never ſo much as denouncing him Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, or uncapable to rule becauſe a perſecutor of Chriſts Saints: nay, they were ſo far from this, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded others for conſcience ſake to obey Heathen Princes, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their power which is from God; which power, as I have partly ſhewed was beyond their compaſs to take from them.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuites being beaten from this hold of the Keys, they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the treble <hi>Paſce</hi> which after Chriſts reſurrection was ſaid unto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Joh. 21. and would fain deduce this power from thence; and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world, that the Shepherds Crook is the Arms of all other Sees not of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Biſhop thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ordinary Paſtor, but one that is known by more Nable bearing; <hi>viz.

But this by the way.</p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:121658:202"/>
               <p>They would fain perſwade the world,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The treble</hi> Paſce <hi>doth not extend to depoſe Kings.</hi>
                  </note> that this power was given to <hi>Peter</hi> by vertue of the treble <hi>Paſce;</hi> and by his being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is devolved upon the Pope: which I have already touched, in the ſecond Chapter, That nothing doth belong to <hi>Rome,</hi> any more then anyother See Apoſtolique, by any power thereby given. I will onely, for better illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent point add this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> both ſubmitted unto <hi>Domitius Nero,</hi> a cruel Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and perſecutour; neither did they thunder out any Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againſt him, thereby denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him uncapable to rule; which if they had thought to have been ſo, certainly they would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it at their ſufferings, when they ſaw they muſt die, and all hopes of their natural lives debarr'd from them.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffered at Rome, he left no ſuch Teſtimony behind him, nor <hi>Paul</hi> neither; ſo that for the Pope to aſpire to this prerogative upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſcore, is an injury to that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle, he having received rules
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:121658:203"/>from his Maſter Chriſt to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of which both he, and the reſt of the Apoſtles were faithful witneſſes in their ſufferings.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts beaten from all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, there being neither from thence, nor any practice Apoſtolical, the leaſt warrant for this their preſumptuous claim, they then begin to ſtrive with fleſh &amp; blood; and forſaking the rules of Chriſt, and the exmples of <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they would have <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock of the Catholike Church, they quit the harbor adjoyning to that Rock, and rove themſelves upon the billows of ſtrange conteſts: And as when the Fiſh <hi>Meron</hi> perceiving a ſtorm, lays hold upon a chance pimple ſtone, &amp; thinks to ſave it ſelf from the toſſing of the waves by ſticking to that, whenas both it and its ſtone are tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to and fro at the will of the ſea; ſo theſe men think by a new-found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of their own, to make good this their bold aſſertion againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whenas any reaſonable Chriſtian may eaſily refute the ſame; and if with reaſon they will not be driven off it,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:121658:203"/>daſh their brains againſt <hi>Peters</hi> Rock. Wherfore they bluſh not to affirm that God was not provident enough to his Church if he ſhould leave her without a head to rule and govern her, and as a widow to be deſpoiled by any Heather or perſecuting Prince; and therefore of neceſſity the Pope muſt have this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: they are the principal wards in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Keys to depoſe Princes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſubjects to oppoſe them, if occaſion be; otherwiſe the Church ſhould want the Pope her Head, that Pillar to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and that Eye to direct her; as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Allen</hi> in his Apology obſerves.

               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine of <hi>Allen</hi> is groſs and Heatheniſh, tending to Blaſphemy and infidelity: infidelity in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he having promiſed his Spirit to his Church to the end of the world, and that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it: ſhe ſhall not be totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated from off the earth till <hi>Shilo</hi> come, though ſhe may be inviſible in this or that Country as I have ſhewed in the fifth Chapter; and therefore Chriſt bids his Apoſtles ſuffer for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake: for <hi>Sanguis martyrum</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſemen Eccleſiae.</hi> Wherfore for
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:121658:204"/>
                  <hi>Allen</hi> to affirme that the Pope muſt have this power or the Church will be loſt, argues his diſtruſt in Gods promiſe to his Church.</p>
               <p>And it likewiſe ſavours of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to tye Gods providence to the Papal Chair, and ſo denying him a power or will to remove the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick from <hi>Rome.</hi> and to give it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Providence (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it, <hi>Aquinas ſumma contr. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>) is ſaid to be inviſible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Gods ſecret councel, <hi>Nondum rebus impreſſa:</hi> for after it appears, and ſhowes it ſelf in effects ſenſible, then it is called Fate, not Providence. Now for him to tax God of improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, unleſs the Pope ſhould have this viſible power of depoſing Kings, is neither Scholar nor Divine like; he might as a Sooth-ſayer of <hi>Egypt,</hi> experimentally, upon the coincidence of the effect of ſome inſpection or Heatheniſh obſervation; as that when the black <hi>Eagle</hi> ſhall preach upon <hi>Laterane</hi> Steeple, the top of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> ſhall be lifted up, as was at the time of <hi>Otho</hi> 3. and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or have foretold that it was
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:121658:204"/>the Fate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that if any Prince withſtood the Pope, he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as was in <hi>Henry</hi> 4. and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> 7. dayes; but not to conclude this upon Gods Providence, which no man by the reach of humane reaſon is able to pry into: it is more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then the conſult of fleſh and blood can apprehend. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>How unſearchable are his Iudgements, and his waies paſt finding out! who hath knowne the minde of the Lord, or who was his Counſellor?</hi> Rom. 11.34. And will <hi>Allen</hi> take upon him to circumſcribe Gods Providence? To know the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of mans heart, is Gods attribute: but ſuch is the groſs impiety of this blaſphemous man, that rather then the Pope ſhould want excuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings, he will take upon him to know Gods heart, and prove this prerogative by Gods Providence; whereby he runs himſelf upon theſe abſurdities.</p>
               <p>He doth hereby ſpoyle the honour and credit of the glorious <hi>Martyrs,</hi> by accuſing them of error or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: of error, for tamely ſuffering,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:121658:205"/>whenas they ſhould have reſiſted; of ignorance, if they ſuffered, becauſe they knew not the will of God herein. And he doth likewiſe give God the lye: for if it was God's providence to his Church to reſiſt, in caſe Religion be oppoſed by the Prince, ſure he would not have bid <hi>Peter</hi> go back into <hi>Rome</hi> (as the Papiſts pretend) nor would he have preſcribed the forementioned rules of obedience, which are diametrically oppoſite to <hi>Allens</hi> pretended knowne Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>It is not the revealed will of God, that the Croſier ſhould reſiſt the Scepter, and the Mitre the Crown; none of the Fathers of <hi>Romes</hi> Church ever practiſed or publiſhed that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine before <hi>Hildebrands</hi> daies: and if it was Gods Providence firſt known to <hi>Allen,</hi> then <hi>Allen</hi> proves the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible for 1074 yeares after Chriſt; and hereupon he has quite ſpoyled the Doctor; for by this means, he has hudwinkt his marks of <hi>Romes</hi> truth, to wit, Antiquity, Univerſality, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:121658:205"/>
               <p>But my Cardinal thinks to ſalve up this errour by another trick, and that almoſt as groſs as this; onely this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon the Divinity, that upon the Apoſtles perſonally. He takes upon him to make known to us what was the ſecret opinion of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> which have ſuffered for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit that they ſuffered becauſe they wanted power to reſiſt; not that it was the will of God they ſhould do ſo; and ſo he makes the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and holy Martyrs diſſemblers, ſpeaking one thing, and thinking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, ſaith he, as ſoon as a Prince begins to appear heretical <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> though Excommunication be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, he ſhall be put from his Kingdom: for as Fame, ſo Hereſie gathers ſtrength by going forward. Which Axiome of his is verified in this, for that ſince he wrote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> plows with his heifer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the ſame Doctrine. So that hereby S. <hi>Paul</hi> is accuſed of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, That he ſhould bid the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> obey for faſhion-ſake to pleaſe the times: and ſo he makes the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle an object of ſcorn, not
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:121658:206"/>pity; That he ſhould be a time-ſerver, and yet play his cards ſo badly, that he could not humour <hi>Domitius Nero</hi> better. Is it likely that the Apoſtles would have commanded others to pray for them, if they would have taken their blood if they could? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe Cardinals would have them like the Presbyters of <hi>England</hi> who prayed for King <hi>Charles,</hi> whilſt their Armies kept him in priſon; or like <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who commanded prayers to be made for <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh his deliverance, and ſuffered his own Bands to confine him. Is it likely S. <hi>Peter</hi> preaching the Word, would bid them ſubmit, which Word he ſaid ſhould endure for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25. even that Word which was preached amongſt them, if he knew that it was lawful for them to reſiſt if they had power? This were to aſcribe want of faith to <hi>Peter,</hi> that God would never deliver his Church out of the hands of Perſecutors, but ſuffer her to be always under Tyrants; or elſe that <hi>Peter</hi> taught one thing, and thought another. And why ſhould both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> preſs this duty
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:121658:206"/>of obedience and ſubmiſſion and that not for wrath, but for conſcience ſake, were it lawful to reſiſt? This affertion of the Cardinal is therefore groſs and impious. It is plain by the Scripture, that this duty of ſubmiſſion to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power was a precept enjoyned by God, not proceeding from any fear, (the production of a baſe nature.) And whenas <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and recommend this duty to others, it was to give a teſtimony of their faith in Jeſus; who, as he had laid down his life for them (who wanted no power to have withſtood the Jews: he might have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed legions of Angels to have come and reſcued him out of their hands) in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the will of the Father: ſo they, as obedient ſons of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whom he had in his blood adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would, according to his precepts and example, lay down their lives for the teſtimony of the Goſpel. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> forbade that any ſhould curſe the King ſecretly in his conſcience: which ſure he never would have done, if it had been lawful (having power) to caſt him off. Saint <hi>Jude</hi> calls them
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:121658:207"/>
                  <hi>filthy dreamers</hi> that ſpeak evil of Government, and deſpiſe ſuch as be in Authority: I wonder what he would think of thoſe two Cardinals (were he alive) who would have the Pope drive Kings out of their Kingdomes if he can.</p>
               <p>There are ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who being with <hi>Agrippa</hi> half per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be Chriſtians, and being touched in Conſcience, decline theſe groſs abſudities of <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> as being pernitious, and tending to the injury of Chriſt and his A po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the holy Scripture (and in that, injurious to the holy Ghoſt, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture being nothing elſe but the dictates of that holy Spirit.) But yet for all that, they are ſo bewitched to the Roman Faith, out of a blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of its Antiquity, and therefore of its truth, that they will not leave her, but ſtrive to juſtifie her in all things, and to excuſe this point, for that it is a point controverted by ſome of their owne Church, and not yet decreed by any publique Councel (nor ever muſt it be decided, may the Pope chuſe.) Beſides, ſhould it be referred to a
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:121658:207"/>Councel, there is no credit to be given to the reſult of that Councel, for that none muſt ſit there, but ſuch as firſt muſt ſwear to maintain the Pope in the very point to be controverted; and ſo it would be <hi>coram non judice:</hi> or if it ſhould be decreed againſt his holineſs, yet by the prerogatives Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual of his late <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi>-aſſemblies, he might notwithſtanding repeal that Decree, or chuſe to obey it, for that he is by them declared to be above Councels. And till this be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, this error can receive no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a Councel, nor can any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from thence redound to clear the ſcruples of any mans conſcience in this particular. In the mean time. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is like the Religion of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees: Councels declare one thing <hi>de fide,</hi> the Pope is found contrary <hi>de facto;</hi> ſo that as our Saviour ſaid of the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.3. ſo ſay I of theſe Roman Catholicks. All that ſuch a Councel ſhould ſo decree, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep; but after their works do not: for they ſay and do not.</p>

               <p>That this power is not <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> of right belonging to the Prieſt, I have already proved, in the fourth Chapter and by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,

<note place="margin">The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Pope.</note> was the removing of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which gave an occaſion to the Popes to lord it over the people of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Emperour, for that then there was none appointed above them: and they, in the abſence of the Prince,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:121658:210"/>drew the eyes of the people upon them; and that the rather, becauſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and his ſucceſſors gave great reſpect and honor to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in honour to that City which formerly was the ſeat of the Empire. And even as the Moon gives no ſhine as long as the Sun is viſible in the ſame Horizon; but he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thence ſhe becomes a glorious Lamp, and ſoveraign Lady over the leſſer Stars: ſo the Popes borrowing their light from the Emperour, were nothing illuſtrious before his face; but he having withdrawn the rays of his preſence from the Italian clime, the Pope became the onely admired Lord and Governour over the common people, during the reſidence of the Emperours at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and did ſtill ſteal by degrees into an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of greatneſs amongſt the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> And although <hi>Theodoſius, (anno</hi> 399.) divided the Empire to his two ſons, <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> yet the Weſtern Empire ſtood not long, but like a branch ſlipt off the main bulk, began preſently to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wanting that ſap and nutriment
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:121658:211"/>it formerly received from its old root, whilſt it continued entire, and unſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the ſame; ſo that in leſs then fourſcore yeers, the Weſtern Empire proved Occidental; and ſetting in <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> for above three hundred yeers bade goodnight to the world.</p>
               <p>This obſcurity and privation of the luſtre of the Imperial Diademe, gave again opportunity to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to grope about in the dark for <hi>Rome</hi>'s forſaken Sword and Scepter; and making ſtrict and diligent ſearch, at laſt they found out ſome ſplinters of the late Emperours Staff of Majeſtie, which Staff was ſhattered into many pieces; and having none to own it, they became a prey to any that could lay hold firſt.</p>
               <p>In this ſcattering of the Eagles Princely plumes, all people ſtrove to gather up thoſe noble Enſignes, that they might be the honorable orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their own ſtock and families: And in this general ſtriving to ſhare thoſe imperial portions, it happened ſo, that the buſie and ſtirring <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths</hi> laid hold of part of the Empire in <hi>Spain,</hi> The <hi>Abtenes</hi> in <hi>Guien</hi> and

               <p>A bundle of Arrows is not eaſily broken; but take one by one and any childe may ſnap it in pieces. Even ſo whilſt the Empire ſtood united, the Pope was afraid to attempt any thing againſt it; but now that ſuch divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were run upon it, firſt making the Eagle (Monſter-like) with two heads; after that, her left ſide being pluckt bare, whilſt her left eye was ſhut and her feathers ſcattered thorow all the Weſtern parts; his Holineſs in theſe diviſions aſſumes the confidence to claim a portion.</p>
               <p>But the ſweet thoughts of enjoying ſuch a Princely dowry had no ſooner kindled in his ambitious heart, but behold, a ſtorm aroſe in the North, which did not onely prevent his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquiſitions of thoſe Imperial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, but did quite extinguiſh the ſparks of thoſe glowing embers, which he thought (if not by force pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented)
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:121658:212"/>to have grown to ſuch a flame, that they ſhould have been the light of the Weſtern world.</p>
               <p>The Heavens not ſmiling upon ſuch lofty deſignes, (much unſutable for one that claims to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor) permitted the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> to come down in vengeance upon his proud head, and by their ſubduing ſword, to teach him that Maxime of Divinity which he perhaps had forgot, <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>Man purpoſes, but God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</hi> They let the proud Prelate ſee, that he that yeſterday promiſed an Empire to himſelf, to day can finde no Sanctuary even in his holy Temples, to be ſafe from the fury of a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemy.</p>

                  <hi>Totiles</hi> with his Armies, <hi>an.</hi> 536. forced <hi>Rome</hi> to become a prey to his Souldiery; plundering her houſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyling her Temples demoliſhing her Walls, and proſternating her lofty Spires, the glorious ornaments of her towring head, even to the ground.

               </p>
               <p>And the Weſtern flowers of the Empire being thus returned to grow and flouriſh in their Royal bed of Majeſtie, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were thereby reduced to their firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and thought themſelves happie if they might enjoy the Mitre. Their thoughts were no longer fixed upon a Crown: nay, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo far from bearding with Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, that he was content to be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Governour of <hi>Rome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Exarch of <hi>Ravenna; Juſtinian</hi> at that time ſetting a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veruour over <hi>Italy,</hi> who kept his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and appointed the ſubordinate Officers in the remoter parts of the Italian territories.</p>
               <p>Thus it continued but ſeventeen yeers: for <hi>Narſes</hi> being upbraided by <hi>Sophia, Juſtin</hi>'s wife (whoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit could not brook any affront, eſpecially from them from whom he had very well deſerved) began to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:121658:213"/>check the courſe of his proceedings; and having driven out the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and having gained the hearts of the people of the Country, he was as much through love, as by force maſter thereof, and therefore thought he could preſcribe nothing to the people which they would deny. Whereupon, not fearing the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an ungrateful Maſter, he lets him know, that as he had won <hi>Italy</hi> from the Emperours enemies, he had equal power to diſpoſe of it to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as to his Maſter. And being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged towards the Emperour for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his late affront put upon him, (whereby he became acceſſary to the injury, for that in him onely it lay to redreſs the wrong) he ſent for the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and made them, under their king <hi>Alboinus, anno</hi> 568, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lombards</hi> continued maſters of <hi>Italy</hi> above two hundred yeers:
<note place="margin">Lombards</note> during which time, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> being hopeleſs of any reſpects from them, did withdraw all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours tending that way, and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:121658:213"/>did wholly apply themſelves to the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and the ſucceeding Biſhops (as if the Chair were infectious, and made the owners ambitious, and ſeekers after worldly honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more then regardful for the ſouls of their Flock over which they are made Overſeers) did bend all their endeavours to pleaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that being gracious with him, they might (by his favour) lord it over the reſt of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.</p>
               <p>And whereas formerly,

               <p>From this foundation of their Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they not long after raiſe another ſuperſtructure, (which being a chip of that block, and having that example of <hi>Phocas,</hi> the ſucceeding Pope thought the Emperour of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> could not blame it.) Pope <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> being ſent unto by <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to know whether he might depoſe his Maſter <hi>Childerick,</hi> the Pope (good man) never made ſcruple of conſcience at it: for he knew that <hi>Pepin</hi> was his good friend, and was an able States-man, and knew how to ſettle his affairs, both for his own ſecurity and advantage, and ſo might be in a condition to do courteſies for the Pope; who, upon conſideration hereof, did aſſoil both him and the reſt of the ſubjects of <hi>France</hi> from their promiſed Allegiance to <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and by that means was <hi>Pepin</hi> ſetled in the Throne of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe tranſactions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the Weſt, the Empire in the Eaſt was got into a declining condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Saracens encroaching upon them, and having brought them to that ſtrait, that Caliph <hi>Zulciman</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged

               <p>The crafty Popes ſeeing the glory of the Eaſtern, Empire to look pale and wan, and perceiving that the <hi>Lombards</hi> began to gather more ſtrength and heart by the depreſſions of the Imperial power, thought it was in vain for them any longer to flatter the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that becauſe if he was not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the injuries done unto him by the Saracens, much leſs to be aſſiſtant to the Pope if he ſtood in need: wherefore they withdrew their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of humility and reſpect from the Eaſtern to the Weſtern clime; and Italian-like, will not beſtow a cake upon him, that has not one in the oven to requite it. The Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon theſe important conſiderations, quite leaves off the Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and inſinuates altogether with the French King, he being one that was endeared to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> for the late courteſie done him; and withal being powerful, might ſtand by the Pope in his neceſſities; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly fell out. For it happened that the <hi>Lombards</hi> ſeeing the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:121658:215"/>of their great enemy the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, they began to enlarge their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in <hi>Italy.</hi> They took <hi>Ravenna</hi> from the Empire, being the ſeat of their Exarch, and beſieged <hi>Rome:</hi> whereupon, Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the ſecond made ſuit to <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to march to their relief; who coming with a numerous and powerful army againſt <hi>Aſtulphus</hi> King of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> beſieged him in <hi>Pavie,</hi> and conſtrained him to yeeld to his mercy; who, in this his ſtrait and neceſſity, yeelded up the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Peutopolis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being thus accompliſhed,

               <p>This is the Popes Royal Charter, by which he entitles himſelf to this Celeſtial power: and this is the chief and principal Canon of the Popes Law.

And I much wonder the Chriſtian Princes will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Pope, upon ſuch groundleſs and unjuſt terms, to be Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount over them, whenas the warrant by which he claims this power, is meerly void in it ſelf, for that it wants their concurrence.

Alas, it was not the Popes Bull could excuſe that: the Pope cannot diſpenſe with inſeparable duties, eſpecially when the

               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth maintain, That Chriſts body is given, received, and eaten, after an heavenly and ſpiritual, not after a carnal and corporal manner; and doth utterly diſallow of the new doctrine of <hi>Romes</hi> Tranſubſtantiation: not condemning it as new, in reſpect of the Word; but as it is a doctrine and practice in it ſelf

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:121658:226"/>has warrant from Chriſt himſelf, who ſpeaking of the bread of life which came down from heaven, and the bread which he would give them, which was his fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. the Jews and many of his diſciples were offended, ſaying, <hi>How can he give us his fleſh to eat, and his blood to drink?</hi> Chriſt perceiving their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, (that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ignorance) explains it to them, ſaying, <hi>What if you ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?

But it rather ſerveth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their errours, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that the wicked receive very Chriſt; and ſo none ſhould be guilty, becauſe whoſo verily eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood, hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. Therefore the Church of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:121658:227"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> is careful to avoid this error, and maintains, according to Chriſt his explanation, that Chriſt is onely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually given, received, and eaten; and that thoſe onely that believe in Chriſt, eat him, and live by him; and that every one eating that bread according to Chriſts inſtitution and Ordinance, is aſſured, by Chriſts own promiſe and teſtament, that he is a member of his body, and receives the benefit of his paſſion: and likewiſe be that drinks of that cup according to Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is certified that he is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of Chriſt his legacie, his blood, which was ſhed for remiſſion of ſins. Whereas the unworthy receiver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this divine Ordinance without due reverence and a lively faith, eateth and drinketh his own damnation; for that he receiveth that bread and that wine unworthily, which ought with faith to have been received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that as that bread and wine nouriſh the outward man, ſo Chriſt is thereby conveyed, to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inner man; and ſo Chriſt is in him, and he in Chriſt. And by thus receiving, is the ſaying of Chriſt
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:121658:228"/>(in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>My fleſh is very meat, and my blood is very drink</hi>) to be underſtood: for none but the faithful are partakers of this heavenly ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. Chriſt is the bread of life: he that eateth that bread, ſhall live for ever; which muſt be by faith in the Son of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. It muſt needs be underſtood of a myſtical, and not a real eating; that even as the bread and wine which we receive, is turned into our fleſh and blood, and is ſo joyned and mixed together with our fleſh and blood, that they be made one body together: ſo be all faithful Chriſtians ſpiritually turned into the body of Chriſt, and be ſo joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and alſo together amongſt themſelves, that they do but make one myſtical body of Chriſt, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>We be one bread and one body, as many as be partakers of one bread and one cup.</hi> The wicked are not partakers of this banquet, but onely the members of Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none verily eat the fleſh and drink the blood, but the believers. It is not like the eating of Manna: both good and bad ate that; ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:121658:228"/>
                  <hi>Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderneſs, and are dead: but he that eateth of this bread ſhall live for ever;</hi> which muſt be by faith, and in heart believing unto this ſalvation. And herewith agree the Fathers of the Primitive Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> who writ about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeers after Chriſt, upon the text of <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and very meat, which whoſo eateth, ſhall live for ever;</hi> ſays, that no evil man can eat thereof: for it is onely eaten by faith. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with agrees S. <hi>Cyprian, in Serm. de Coena Dominic.</hi> ſaying, Our eating and drinking is a certain hunger and deſire to dwell in him; and that none do eat of this Lamb, but ſuch as be true Iſraelites; which hunger is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſoul, as <hi>David</hi> was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>My ſoul hath thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after God, which is the well of life.</hi> For the ſoul feeling nothing but the horrour of death, and the terrour of Gods juſtice, ſin, by the Laws im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, having drawn that dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence upon her; in her penſive meditations of her juſt demerits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:121658:229"/>her ſelf to this ſpiritual refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of comfort and ſolace, being hereunto invited with the ſweet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of bleſſed, if ſhe hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; and a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promiſe of comforts, that ſhe ſhall be ſatisfied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Which ſpiritual hunger and thirſt, as it is not perceived of a carnal man, but onely of ſuch as inwardly deſire this refreſhment, and eaſe from the deep throws of their ſad condition: ſo is it not given to any, but ſuch as ſpiritually long and ſeek after it. God feedeth the hungry; but the rich thoſe that ſtand upon their own integrity, he ſends empty away. It is no carnal banquet, that fleſh and blood can thirſt after: <hi>Have ye no houſes to eat and drink in?</hi> 1 Cor. 11. It is not eating an ordinary Supper, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the greedy appetite of a natural man; but, as Chriſt ſaid to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.32. <hi>I have other meat to eat, which ye know not.</hi> The diſciples themſelves, as carnal men, knew not of this ſpiritual food; and therefore Chriſt minding to draw them from their groſs fleſhly principles, and to convince
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:121658:229"/>them that there is ſpiritual food, as well as that which the mouth and throat take and ſwallow, plainly ſays unto them, <hi>Is any dry? let him come to me,</hi> Joh. 7. for he is meat, he is drink, which whoſoever by faith ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eat and drink, live for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athanaſius, de peccat. in Spir. ſanct</hi> ſays, Chriſt made mention of his aſcenſion, to pluck men from corporal fancie, and thereby to perſwade them that his fleſh was ſpiritual food: the things which he ſpake, were ſpirit and life. It muſt needs therefore be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of ſpiritual eating and ſpiritual drinking his fleſh and blood; which hereticks &amp; unbelievers could not do, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. witneſſes. And S. <hi>Ambroſe, de benedict Patr. cap.</hi> 9. ſays, Jeſus is the bread which is the meat of the Saints; and he that taketh this bread, dieth not a ſinners death: for this bread is remiſſion of ſins. And S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his 26 Tract upon <hi>John;</hi> Bread and wine which nouriſheth the body, a man may eat and drink, and nevertheleſs die; but the very body and blood no man eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but hath everlaſting life.</p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:121658:230"/>
               <p>And in another place, <hi>in ſententiis ex Proſp. decerpt. cap.</hi> 339. He that agreeth not with Chriſt, doth neither eat his fleſh, nor drink his blood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (to the condemnation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his preſumption) he every day receive the Sacrament of ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Judas</hi> did eat the bread, ſaith he, in his 59 Tract, but not the bread that was the Lord. Chriſt is onely ſpiritually in the bread and wine, to ſuch as by a lively faith receive him. As for the wicked they receive but the meer bread and wine, abuſing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>From theſe Authorities may clearly be evinced, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth maintain in this point as the ancient Fathers taught, concerning this Sacrament. Nor can any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtand of this holy myſtery: for if Chriſt be corporally in the bread and wine, then the wicked receiving him, receive his body, and not his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. as he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his; ſo he that hath Chriſt in him, believeth, becauſe he is juſtified. <hi>And if his Spirit that raiſed Jeſus from the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:121658:230"/>dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed Chriſt from death, ſhall give life to your mortal bodies,</hi> for his Spirits ſake that dwelleth in you. So that no wicked man hath the Spirit of Chriſt in him: and to maintain that he hath him corporally, and not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is to divide his Humanity from his Divinity; which blaſphemy the Catholike Church abhors.</p>
               <p>Now the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not thus divide the Natures, but holds that both his Body and Spirit is by faith received; but not that the body is corporally in the bread; the bread and wine being but the elementary parts, ſignifying the ſpiritual ſubſtance: and that God worketh this faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in our hearts,
<note place="margin">3. <hi>The bread and wine are but figures of the body and blood.</hi>
                  </note> by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and outwardly confirmeth the ſame to our ears, by the Word; and to our ſenſes, by the eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacramental bread and wine in his holy Supper: Which eating and drinking is a ſpiritual feeding, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no real preſence of Chriſt, but onely in Spirit, grace, and effectual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. And that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> it was but
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:121658:231"/>figuratively ſpoken; it being bread which he brake and gave, as a type, for a remembrance how his body was crucified for us. And let none won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this her tenent, to ſay that Chriſt ſpake in figures, when he did inſtitute this Sacrament: for it is the nature of a Sacrament to be figures and types, ſignifying myſtical grace thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Hence it was that the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims, when the Ark came into the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Iſraelites, ſaid that God was come into the army, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. And God himſelf at that time, by the mouth of his Prophets, ſaid, that from that time that he had brought the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not in houſes, but that he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in tents and tabernacles, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. which was a figurative ſpeech, he ſpeaking that thing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which was to be underſtood of the Ark. Which phraſe of ſpeaking, Chriſt himſelf often uſed; as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11, 17. <hi>The field is the world, The enemy the devil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>I am the vine, you are the branches.</hi> Joh. 4. <hi>I have meat to eat, which you know not.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>I am
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:121658:231"/>the door,</hi> Matth. 12. <hi>He that doth my Fathers will, is my brother and ſiſter,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, and many more, Chriſt ſpake in Parables, Tropes, and Figures; but chiefly, when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Hoc eſt corpus <hi>a figurative ſpeech.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood;</hi> the word <hi>my,</hi> taken for the thing in the cup. Neither is the cup nor the wine Chriſts Teſtament, but a ſigne and figure of his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And admit that by the word <hi>cup</hi> neither the cup nor wine is meant but the blood; yet it is a figure of the Teſtament of Chriſt, which was to be ſealed with his blood. For his blood is not the Teſtament, but the thing that confirms the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is ſo evident a place to diſprove the tenents of <hi>Romes</hi> Church in this particular, that her champions are forced to their laſt refuge of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Scripture; and therefore they render that text thus: <hi>This blood is a new Teſtament in my blood:</hi> which tranſlation I ſubmit to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, whether it be not more ſtrange then any figurative ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith, we muſt be <hi>baptized
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:121658:232"/>with the holy Ghoſt:</hi> this is a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſpeech. So likewiſe, <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> &amp;c. that was a figurative ſpeech, intending thereby ſpiritual regeneration. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that in Baptiſm we <hi>cloathe</hi> us with Chriſt, and be <hi>buried with him</hi> Rom. 6. which are figurative ſpeeches of our newneſs of life, and mortification of ſin. The Paſchal Lamb without ſpot, ſignified Chriſt; the effuſion of that blood, ſignified Chriſt's paſſion; and the ſprinkling of the poſts with blood, whereby the firſt-born eſcaped death, is a type of thoſe which at the laſt day ſhall be ſaved, being ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of Jeſus. As in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. God ſaid. <hi>This is the Lords paſſeover;</hi> which was not the Lords Paſſeover, but a figure repreſenting the Lords paſſing by: ſo Chriſt in the New Teſtament ſays of the bread and wine, <hi>This is my body, This is my blood;</hi> which is not ſo in ſubſtance, but in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A figure hath the name of a thing that is ſignified thereby; as we ſay a mans image is called a man; the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:121658:232"/>figure of a tree, a tree, or the like. So we ſay, Let us go to S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> to S. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Compeſtella,</hi> &amp;c. not meaning thereby the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but underſtanding by the things repreſentive, the things repreſented. Even ſo the bread and wine, though Chriſt call them his body and blood, yet they are not verily ſo, but the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary parts and outward ſignes of the inviſible grace, his fleſh and blood thereby ſignified.</p>
               <p>Nor is this a ſtrange interpretation, but according to Chriſts own figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpeech, ſaying, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>I have much deſired to eat this paſſeover with you.</hi> Which words none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be figurative. God himſelf uſed that figurative ſpeech; and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the onely Son of that Father, to ſſure us of his unity with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head breathes out the ſame Spirit to his Apoſtles; <hi>This is my paſſeover, This is my body, This is my blood</hi> As the ſhedding of that Lamb's blood was a token of the ſhedding of Chriſts blood then to come, and foraſmuch as the Sacraments of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ceaſed and ended in Chriſt; leſt

He did make a new Will and Teſtament, wherein he bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clear remiſſion of ſins; which he ſealed next day with his blood; and inſtituted this holy Sacrament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof; and ordained the ſame in bread and wine, ſaying <hi>This is my body; This cup is my blood, which is ſhed for remiſſion of ſins. Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>As often as we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we come to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this heavenly food, we ſhould ſeriouſly call to minde the wonderful ſufferings, great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and marvelous kindneſs of Chriſt, he offering himſelf for our
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:121658:233"/>redemption; and, by a lively faith apply the merits of his Paſſion to our ſouls: and ſo we verily receive Chriſt, he to be in us, and we in him.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures do ſufficiently ſet forth this truth, That when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus,</hi> it was a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſpeech: and the Church of <hi>England</hi> holds forth this truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all adverſaries and oppoſers thereof. And that in this ſhe may not ſeem arrogant, to aſſume a ſelf-interpretation of the Scriptures, to maintain this her aſſertion, <hi>I</hi> will bring in ſome ancient Fathers to bear witneſs for her.</p>

               <p>The Councel of <hi>Florens</hi> treating upon the Sacrament of Confirmation, have reſolved that all Sacraments muſt conſiſt of matter and form: there muſt be an outward ſigne, to ſignifie
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:121658:236"/>the inward grace. Wherefore I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Papiſts can for ſhame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the matter of bread and wine ſhould remain in the Euchariſt: for, by this means they deny it to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, deſtroying the end of Chriſts holy inſtitution; which was, That it ſhould be had in remembrance of him. And they generally gainſay the publike profeſſion of their Church, by the contradictory practices in private and particular Maſſes and Altar-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. And they likewiſe go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, who ſays, <hi>This bread is my body:</hi> He did not ſay. This is no bread, but my body. And certainly, if Chriſt would have had us to think the ſubſtance of the elements were changed, he would not have called them <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>the fruit of the vine.</hi> Nay, he would not, when he explained the words of giving his fleſh to eat, and his blood to drink, have ſaid, his words were ſpirit and life. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this truth with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſays, <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> He thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:121658:237"/>Chriſts ſaying, <hi>Hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum,</hi> to be meant of a ſpiritual eating, and of a communion of his body we being hereby made one with Chriſt; he dwelling in us, and we in him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when Chriſt bade them drink all of the Cup, it was wine he bade them drink: for the words of conſecration follow. And therefore, if the Apoſtles drank any thing elſe, they did not fulfil the precept; or elſe Chriſt commanded them to drink that that was not there; which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to imagine. And as for the bread, it is called bread after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls bread the communion of Chriſts body; which muſt needs be underſtood of bread conſecrate, otherwiſe it is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his body. So that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that the elements of bread and wine remain in the Sacrament, and are not materially changed. And this the Monks which adminiſtred to King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſeventh the Emperour, knew well enough: which Princes, the better to further the holy deſignes of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:121658:237"/>the Pope, were diſpatched hence out of this world by the poyſoned ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Euchariſt; which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Chriſt ordained Sacramentally to be received, for our nouriſhment; thereby ſignifying our communion with Chriſt, by the bread and wine, made of many ears and many grapes; and our growing up by faith in Jeſus: even as thoſe elements turn into our fleſh and blood by natural digeſtion, ſo Chriſt is ſpiritually conveyed unto our ſouls, which are fed by his fleſh and blood, which every faithful and worthy receiver is, by the receiving of this Sacrament, made partaker of.</p>
               <p>The Doctor would perſwade us, <hi>fol.</hi> 327. that if, by denying the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence, we mean onely not with accidents of his body, as quantity, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and the like; and that Chriſt is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e would again perſwade us that Chriſt cannot be really there unleſs his body be there; and that it muſt be as well corporally as ſpiritually there, or elſe we deny Chriſts being there.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:121658:238"/>
               <p>To which I anſwer,
<note place="margin">The errour of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> We by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ſpiritual eating and drinking of the body and blood, do not divide the ſpirit from the body, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, by maintaining a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence; becauſe, according to their doctrine, the wicked receive the body, and not the Spirit, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved: we by taking the bread and wine, which tend to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our outward bodies, the thing ſignified by them, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, is hereby conveyed unto us, to be the food of our ſouls, and becomes ſpirit and life to us; he living in us, and we in him: and this is onely to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver, who by faith feeds upon him, and lays hold of the benefits of his Paſſion: The ungodly, they onely receive the bread &amp; wine, not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords body. And if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> mean that his body is ſignificantly there preſent, then they agree with us: but if really in the bread, then we do not concur in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, for the reaſons afore in pare rehearſed, and for other reaſons hereafter following.</p>
               <p>I might inſtance many particular
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:121658:238"/>reaſons againſt this Romiſh errour of Tranſubſtantiation; as that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nothing was broken, eaten, drunken, and chawed, but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the body, (becauſe they deny the bread and wine to be the viſible elements) which is againſt Reaſon, and all authority: or elſe if they will have a body there, That it is without accidents; and ſo they muſt either make accidents without ſubſtances, or ſubſtances without accidents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the bread mouldeth, and turneth into worms; or the wine ſowreth, or turneth into vinegar; it is the bread mouldeth, and the wine that ſowreth: Chriſt is <hi>the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day, and for ever:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the bread and wine ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially there: and if they were but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, then no body could be made thereof, as worms, or material vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let a dog, or cat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eat of that bread, and he is nouriſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: which could not be, if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance remained not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture calleth them bread and wine, after conſecration;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:121658:239"/>which are names of ſubſtance, not of accidents; which if ſubſtance remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, it were a meer illuſion of our ſenſes; and ſo we with the Jews make Chriſt a Jugler, making things appear to our outward ſenſes, which are not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sacrament had a beginning, and hath an end put to it: it is to be received in remembrance of Chriſts death, till he come, and then to ceaſe. Wherefore there can be no real tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated preſence of Chriſt: for he is from eternity to eternity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If there be a tranſubſtantiated body of Chriſt, then is Chriſt every day new made; and as many Wafers, as many Chriſts: which is impoſſible for his ſubſtantial body to be in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places either in the ſeveral Wafers or the ſeveral places of conſecration at one and the ſame inſtant of time.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This doctrine doth impugn the conſent of the ancient Catholike Church, which <hi>de fide</hi> profeſſeth and believeth Chriſt to be made of the nature and ſubſtance of his bleſſed mother, and therefore not every day to be made anew of the ſubſtance of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:121658:239"/>bread and wine: for if it were ſo, then the ſame body that was crucified, is not eaten; or elſe, that body which was crucified, was made of bread and wine: which is flat blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, by whoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Chriſt was made and born of the fleſh of his mother, and ſuffered upon the Croſs for the ſalvation of all believers. Which Chriſt is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe joyned to the elements in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but Sacramentally, as the holy Ghoſt in Baptiſm is joyned to the water; not that the holy Spirit is made of the ſubſtance of the water, or the water turned into the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is againſt the expreſs Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and Symbole of Faith ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that Scripture; which teaches that Chriſt, concerning his body and humane nature, is in heaven. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was conceived of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dead &amp; buried; that he deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into hell; the third day he roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the dead, and aſcended into heaven, and ſits at the right hand of God the Father; from whence he
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:121658:240"/>ſhall come to judge both quick and dead. Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>I leave the world,</hi> Joh. 16. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Ye ſhall ever have poor folks with you, but me ye ſhall not have always.</hi> Mark 16. <hi>He was taken up into heaven, and ſits at the right hand of his Father,</hi> Col. 1.3. Heb. 8. and Heb. 10. <hi>He ſits continually at the right hand of God.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 3. faith, that <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall contain him until the time that all things ſhall be reſtored.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf gave warning of this errour aforehand, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. ſaying, <hi>The time will come, when there ſhall be many deceivers in the world, which ſhall ſay, Here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the whole current of the Scripture makes againſt this Romiſh errour of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Papiſts may not object againſt us, that it is a novel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, or our miſ-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture in this point; I will make it manifeſt, that the Primitive Church never taught this doctrine of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:121658:240"/>Tranſubſtantiation, but were utterly againſt it, as may appear by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of theſe ancient Fathers.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Epiſt. 55. <hi>ad Dardanium:</hi> Chriſt, as concerning his Manhood, is now there, from whence he ſhall come to judge both quick and dead: and as he aſcended, ſo ſhall he come, in the ſelf-ſame form and ſubſtance to the which he gave immortality, but thereby did not change the nature.

               <p>
                  <hi>Irenaeus contr. Valent. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. who wrote about 150 yeers after Chriſt, and was a diſciple of <hi>Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> who was a diſciple of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, ſays, The bread wherein we give thanks to God, hath two things in it; one earthly, another hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: by the heavenly, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſanctification which cometh by the invocation of the name of God; and by the earthly, the ſubſtance of bread which doth nouriſh our bodies.</p>
               <p>Shortly after <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> was <hi>Origen,</hi> about 200 yeers after Chriſt, who affirms, <hi>in Matth. cap.</hi> 15. that the material bread remains, whoſe matter availeth nothing but goeth down into the belly, and is voided downward: but the Word ſpoke upon the bread, is it that availeth.</p>

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:121658:244"/>by walking after any known Law, ſo neither was it ſafe for them to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch new Laws as the Councel it ſelf propoſed; the Councel altering every day her own Laws, as time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred occaſion for ſelf-advantage: ſo that <hi>Athens</hi> was in a miſerable condition, during this ſlavery of her Legiſlative power, not diſſolvable by any Authority; the people not having liberty to diſſolve it, and to call, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require, a Councel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs grievances, and not otherwiſe to continue, but to be diſſolved, that ſo in the intervals they might know what Law ſtood good and unalterable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>

               <p>It is reported that a Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> about the time of this change, did ſhew unto ſome, for their converſion, the Hoſt turned into fleſh, and blood in outward appearance dropping into the Chalice; and that thereupon they believed Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
               <p>Another is reported by <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> of one <hi>Plegildus</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Almain,</hi> who did ſee and handle viſibly the ſhape of a childe upon the Altar; and after it turned into bread, and he was to receive it.</p>
               <p>Another is reported of a Jew-boy, who coming into the Church with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:121658:246"/>boy which was a Chriſtian, he ſaw upon the Altar a little childe torn in pieces, and afterwards by portions diſtributed: which he reporting was condemned to be burned; but was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſcued from the flame by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>Theſe Miracles were the onely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments uſed againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and the convincing perſwaſions of the facile conſciences of thoſe days: which how it ſtands with the doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. the practice of the Apoſtles, the profeſſion of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, and the faith and doctrine of the ancient Fathers, let any judge. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>That which he had received of the Lord Jeſus, that he delivered;</hi> That <hi>as often as they did eat the bread, and drink the cup, they ſhewed the Lords death till he came.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>bread,</hi> and the Evangeliſt <hi>wine,</hi> and that after conſecration: and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church taught that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with them: and Chriſt himſelf calls them <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>fruit of the vine;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul, The communion of the body.</hi> And this being the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:121658:247"/>of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though an Angel from heaven ſhould come and teach any other doctrine, let him be accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, theſe miraculous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions were no ground for <hi>Rome</hi> to change her faith in this point. If theſe ſtories be true, they ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as extraordinary apparitions, like the light from heaven which ſhone about S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Theſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miraculous apparitions, were but to perſwade the conſciences of Infidels and Heathens to turn to the faith of Chriſt, and to be perſwaded of the truth of that Sacrament; and not to make the true and already-grounded Chriſtians to change the nature of their faith, which is the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of things which are not ſeen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. This was to perſwade the miſ-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jew of Chriſt, and of the truth of this bleſſed Sacrament, whereby he was to be made partaker of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his precious death and paſſion; not to teach the Chriſtian any new doctrine concerning the ſame. Theſe miracles ſhould rather confirm him in
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:121658:247"/>his faith received, that it was a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual banquet; in reſpect that after the apparition (as the ſtory runs) at the receiving, that which was received was become bread again; and not to enſnare him into this novel errour which was contrary to Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Apoſtles preaching, and the practice of the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>But I will no longer inſiſt upon this point. I ſubmit to any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whether it be ſafer to follow Chriſts explanation of this myſtery to be ſpiritual, (with which S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the ancient Fathers do concur) then to humour the times, and to be obſervant to the late Popes; which, about the time of this change, were grown great, and ſince have, by cunning practices, enlarged that power; inſomuch that now they are declared above Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; and whatſoever they propound, muſt <hi>de fide</hi> be received, upon the ſcore of their infallibility, be it never ſo contrary to the truth of Gods Word. And they by this doctrine receiving advantage by their Altar-Sacrifices, will not eaſily be induced to renounce the errour thereof: and though never
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:121658:248"/>ſo palpably againſt the Truth of God, yet the Jeſuites will maintain it for their Maſters advantage; this doctrine tending more to his avail, then any good to the ſouls of his flock. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Church of <hi>England</hi> having a right to reform errours in her own Province, has choſen to caſt off this blinde tenent of the Pope and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites: and ſhe having the warrant of Chriſt, the rules of the Apoſtles, the practice of the Primitive Church, and the conſent of the ancient Fathers, for her doctrine in this point, hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made choice with them, in unity of Spirit, firmly to hold and maintain that Chriſt in his humanity is not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and corporally in the Sacrament, but figuratively in the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being thereby ſignified; and is ſpiritually eaten and drunken of the worthy receiver.</p>

               <p>THe Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having thus gained a general conſent (though at firſt forced upon many, by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and domineering of the Popes) to her doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; ſhe ſtuck not long in this ſtation, but, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make good what ſhe had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Church, and partly to ſhew to the world the divine Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power of her Head, ſhe ſoared a pitch higher: &amp; whereas before this ſhe but maintained an opinion (which but to ſome weak capacities did convince, all not being ſatisfied with the ſincerity
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:121658:249"/>of her doctrine) concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſtituted, and by his laſt Will and Teſtament left it as a Legacie to his faithful ſervants; her Popes now take upon them (after their former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was confirmed by Councel, and generally received and believed as an Article of Faith) to diſpenſe with that Sacrament of Chriſt Jeſus, and have in ſtead thereof inſtituted one of their own making; adminiſtring in one kinde, and denying the Cup to the Lay-people: which is a novel trick of Papal invention, and never practiſed in the Churches upon earth, till they forced it upon ſome over which the Popes did without controul rule at will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus did inſtitute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both kindes. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns both; the whole Church did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in both; and the Fathers teach, that as well the wine, as the bread, is to be received; and did think wine ſo neceſſary, that it could not be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in water, much leſs in the cake alone, in which there is no liquid ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  </hi> a ſtrict Injunction is laid, that all receive in both kindes, for that the dividing of that Sacrament is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>I need not inſtance in this any more particulars, in reſpect that none can deny but that anciently it was in both kindes adminiſtred. I will therefore examine the reaſons the Church of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:121658:250"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> gives for her alteration from this antient way, and for adminiſtring in one kind; and in ſo doing, I ſhall plainly lay open her errors in this point.</p>
               <p>The Councel of <hi>Conſtance</hi> held 1414.
<note place="margin">Councel of Conſtance.</note> 
                  <hi>Seſ.</hi> 13. decreed <hi>Quod nullus Presbyter, ſub conditione excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicationis, communicet populo ſub utroque ſpecie Panis &amp; Vini.</hi> Which notwithſtanding, the Councel of <hi>Baſil</hi> did after reſtore to the people again, <hi>Anno</hi> 1431. So that in this new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of hers, <hi>Rome</hi> has met with much controverſie even in her ſelf. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Pope decreeing it to be ſacrilegious to omit either kind; by which it is evident, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has erred <hi>de fide:</hi> For <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius</hi> taught that judicially as Pope, and the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Pope <hi>John</hi> 23. and this Councel of <hi>Baſil</hi> by <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4. Which proceedings wound the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſpoiles her unity; one Pope being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, and one Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another: To decide which ſtrivings, the late Prerogative Royal
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:121658:250"/>of the Popes being above Councels was therefore decreed; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by that means the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is made infallible, yet it ſpoiles her of her marks of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and conſtant viſibility, and therefore abſolutely ſpoiles her for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken to be the onely Catholick Church; for if ſo, then the Catholick Church was once utterly extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from off the earth; which is againſt Gods promiſe, and impious to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>The Pope being thus grown above Councels, he now (as he pleaſes) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares this Councel void, the other to be of force; and by vertue of this his Prerogative, he has approved the Councel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and yet but in part, for he onely takes as much out of that Councel as makes for his turn; he onely confirmes their Decree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Cup to the Laity; but their other Decree of the power of Councels to be above the Pope, that's abominable; and his Holineſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that Decree to, be believed to be Heretical. By this is to be noted, that the Popiſh Religion is a noſe of
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:121658:251"/>wax, as pleaſeth his Holineſs to ſet it forth: it muſt be received upon the ſcore of his infallibility: though it be never ſo deſtructive to former Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian principles, to the ruine of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and overthrowing of the true antient Catholick Faith; yet ſuch is the condition of the Pope, that his will can guide him into no tenent, (though never ſo contrary to truth) but his faithful Papal ſervants the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites will dawb over his rotten Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with the ſmooth plaiſters of humane reaſon, and think with ſubtile Sophiſtry to beguile the ſimple; the deluding of whom, doth not in their uneven hands counterpoiſe the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Maſter the Pope; and therefore did they ſtrive to varniſh over this new point of Communion in one kind, with ſome counterfeit Paint: Will you pleaſe to take a view thereof, and I hope I ſhall ſo far convince their reaſons, that the caſe will meerly ſtand upon the Popes will; and if ſo, I preſume none will be ſo irreverent to their Maſter Chriſt, to forſake his inſtitution, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Popes inſtitution, leſt they

               <p>The Doctor would perſwade that it was no precept to receive in both kindes; but onely being of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and not precept, the Church has power to alter it as occaſion may ſerve.</p>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:121658:253"/>giving, and the Apoſtles of receiving dead Chriſt, which is groſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious: Beſides, he himſelf has anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as to that objection, <hi>fol.</hi> 338. for (ſaith he) the Prieſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under both, doth not receive two Sacraments, becauſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eſſentially and entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under either kind; and being received both at once, they make but one refection, ſignifying one thing, and producing one effect; no more (ſaith he) then 6 or 7 diſhes of meat make but one dinner. Now as the Prieſt doth not divide the fleſh and blood, and receive two Sacraments, no more do we; and if the Doctor would have adviſedly conſidered with himſelf, when he taxed us in this, he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have perceived that he did through our ſides wound Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, for that ſhe adminiſtred, and her people received in both kinds, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner; and unleſs he can ſhew ſtronger reaſons then theſe for her change, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> deſires her not to cenſure too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely of her, for not conforming with
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:121658:254"/>her; for that ſhe is not eaſily induced to forſake the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and for that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be adminiſtred in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt, ſhe conceives we ought not to forget the manner of Chriſts inſtitution, were there no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for it; but eſpecially ſith we are enjoyned ſo to do, we deſire to drink the blood, and to eat the fleſh, that we may have eternal life thereby.</p>
               <p>We muſt drink his blood,
<note place="margin">Eating and drinking.</note> as well as eat his fleſh; and although as the Doctor affirms, (admitting Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation) we may be ſaid to drink that that is drinkable, and eat that that is eatable, yet we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the end for which we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to drink that blood, which is, in remembrance that Chriſts blood was ſhed; <hi>This Cup is my blood in the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins, Matth.</hi> 26.28. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſing, that it was Chriſts will it ſhould be drunk in remembrance thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. which cannot be properly ſignified in the Cake, there being no outward Element to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:121658:254"/>the ſhedding of Chriſtr blood, and precious price of our redemption, and for which end this Sacrament was ordained. Beſides, Chriſt calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Vine as well as the Bread, and we hereby become Branches, lively, growing, and budding upon our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living Root Chriſt Jeſus; whoſe holy inſtitution whilſt we follow, and reject any other rule of humane inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, we may truly ſay, <hi>We bear not the Root, but the Root beareth us,</hi> Rom. 11.18.</p>

                  </note> to avoid the precept of Chriſt in relation to the Cup takes upon him to conſtrue <hi>and</hi> for <hi>or, Joh.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh, and drink the blood,</hi> (he reads it, <hi>or</hi> drink the blood) <hi>ye have no life in you:</hi> And this he would have done, for avoiding of contradiction; becauſe that in the ſame Chapter, eternal life is promiſed to them that eat onely.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: The Bread is not Sacramentally ſo often in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mentioned alone, as it is with the Cup joyntly; wherefore if avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradiction be the reaſon, then muſt we not admit <hi>or</hi> for <hi>and</hi> in that
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:121658:255"/>of <hi>John</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. For if ſo, then we contradict 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Our Fathers did eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> (Saint <hi>Cyprian, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. ſayes this was prefigured by the bread and wine which <hi>Melchizedek</hi> gave to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14.) and likewiſe that text of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat and drink</hi> &amp;c. And we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do hereby contradict all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, who witneſs with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that Chriſt took the Bread, and alſo (or after the ſame manner) he took the Cup; we muſt not ſay that he took the Bread or the Cup: for ſo we deſtroy the Sacrament, as being of incertainty, and having no certain ground either for its inſtitution, or the precept for the adminiſtring thereof. Wherefore for the Doctor here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue <hi>and, or,</hi> is to multiply contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and ſo his reaſon is become invalid, in reſpect that the general ſcope of the Scripture is, that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is to be adminiſtred under both kinds; therefore it is more ſafe to conſtrue thoſe few places where Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:121658:255"/>Bread alone is mentioned without the Cup, to be underſtood of the whole Sacrament, rather then in many places to wreſt <hi>and</hi> into <hi>or:</hi> For the mentioning of Bread onely, doth not exclude the Cup negatively, but rather (according to <hi>Cyprians</hi> ſpeech) by the naming of part of the action, the whole is to be underſtood; and herewith agreeth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>And we that are many, are one bread, and one body, becauſe we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> We muſt not think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here Saint <hi>Paul</hi> names bread onely, that therefore the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not communicate in the cup; for that is againſt the precedent verſe, where he ſaies, <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt? and the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> Beſides, in the enſuing Chapter he enjoyns both to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that to the people; ſo that where the breaking of Sacramental bread is onely mentioned, we are not thereby to exclude the cup; for the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:121658:256"/>Hebrew phraſe is (under the breaking of bread) to ſignifie the whole feaſt; as in the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Frangere eſurientis panem,</hi> is as well to give drink as bread.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſhould we admit of any other conſtruction, as that when bread is mentioned alone, thereby to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand communion in one kind, we ſhould in that change Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. to teach contrary to the practice of Chriſt, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, which did both receive and deliver to the people under both kinds; which were an impious and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous charge. Wherefore let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſhame confeſs her errors herein, and let her not longer wreſt, mangle, and miſconſtrue Scripture contrary to Chriſts rules herein, contrary to the ſenſe of the Primitive Church, and contrary to the judgement and practice of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers, and her own antient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and that but for ſelf-intereſt, to maintain a new doctrine of her own framing, taken up upon a light ſcore, and never heard of or believed in the Church for a thouſand years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:121658:256"/>Chriſt; and let her confeſs the truth with us herein, by which means ſhe ſhall neither alter the ſenſe, nor wreſt any particular word, to maintain her doctrine herein: and if ſhe will not for unitie ſake, and for communion with us, yet for avoiding an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt her own principles, let her never conſtrue that place of <hi>Luke</hi> to ſignifie an entire Sacrament; for then ſhe makes the whole Sacrament one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking of bread, and deſtroyes Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>As for the Doctor, if he be not herewith ſatisfied, but that he will perſiſt notwithſtanding, that it muſt be underſtood of communion in one kind; and furthermore, to maintain that opinion, will here conſtrue <hi>and</hi> for <hi>or,</hi> I muſt tell him, that he has here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wiped off one error which he elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>fol.</hi> 337. taxed our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. which if it be miſ-tranſlated, it makes nothing for communion in one kind; but whether we receive the one or the other, that we ſhould take heed to receive with due reverence ſo Heavenly a banquet: and it doth further illuſtrate to us, that
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:121658:257"/>though we receive the bread worthily, yet if we receive the cup unworthily, we are guilty of the body and blood; which is an argument (and indeed an abſolute proof) that they both make but a perfect Sacrament of the body and blood; therefore I encline to think with the Doctor, that it is a corruption in our printed Bibles, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <hi>and</hi> for <hi>or;</hi> I find it various from the old copies: and I will not preſume upon the Doctors rule to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it: however, it is ſomething excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, for that in the very ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 26, 28, and 29. verſes, eating the bread, and drinking the cup is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and not eating the bread, or drinking the cup; which upon the Doctors rule (for avoiding contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) ſhould be conſtrued <hi>or:</hi> but whether it be taken <hi>or,</hi> or <hi>and,</hi> yet notwithſtanding it makes nothing for the Popiſh communion in one kind.</p>
               <p>The Doctor layes down for the Prieſts receiving in both kinds,
<note place="margin">Of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Altar by the Prieſt.</note> becauſe he offers up a ſacrifice; I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a little conſider of that: I hope I ſhall give ſatisfaction to any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:121658:257"/>ſoul, that the Prieſt and the people offer up one and the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and if ſo, then by the Doctors rule, they are to receive in both kinds; becauſe (ſaith he) Chriſts ſacrifice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs is not perfectly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented but by both kinds, as it was prefigured in <hi>Melchizedek</hi>'s ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>For the better explaining of this point, it is to be underſtood, that there are two kinds of ſacrifices; one is a perpetual ſacrifice, pacifying Gods wrath, whereby mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins is obtained; which is onely the death of Chriſt, prefigured by the ſacrifices under the Law. The other is a ſacrifice of laud and thankſgiving, which doth not reconcile us unto God, but is offered up of ſuch as be already reconciled unto him, by faith in him, which is the reconciliation for our ſins, even Chriſt Jeſus. By the firſt, Chriſt offered us unto the Father; by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we offer our ſelves and all that we have unto him and his Father; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>A ſacrifice to God, is a contrite heart:</hi> and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. <hi>Alwaies we offer up
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:121658:258"/>to God a ſacrifice of laud and praiſe by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of all people, that they are <hi>A holy Prieſt-hood, to offer up ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papiſts object that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Heb. 9. <hi>Every High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt is ordained to offer up gifts and ſacrifices for ſins,</hi> To prove thereby their ſacrifice of the Altar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up in their Maſs; which who pleaſe to read, may plainly diſcover, that that ſaying is meant of the Prieſts under the Law, who did offer Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks and Goats for the ſins of the people; and therefore in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſuch ſacrifices are ſometimes called Propitiatory ſacrifices, being indeed but ſhaddows and types of Chriſts ſacrifice which was to come, which was the true and perfect ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſins of the whole world: wherefore in the very ſame Chapter S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it were impoſſible our ſins ſhould be taken away by the blood of Oxen and Goats, verſe 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>By his own blood entred he once into the Holy place, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:121658:258"/>Eternal Redemption for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt was ſuch an High-prieſt, that he once offering himſelf, by once ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his blood, did cleanſe the ſins of all that believe; he took unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not onely their ſins which many years before were dead, and put their truſt in him; but likewiſe the ſins of thoſe that (until his coming again) ſhould believe in his Goſpel; ſo that we look for no other Prieſt or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to take away our ſins, but onely his ſacrifice made once for all. If he ſhould have made any oblation for ſin more then once, he ſhould have died more then once; but he hath made a full and plenary oblation for ſin by his death; by the will of God are we ſanctified by the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>For with once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath he conſecrated for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> If Chriſt then have taken upon him the burden of our ſins, and become a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not onely for our ſins, but the ſins of the whole world; if he himſelf have made a full oblation for our ſins, by the offering of his body once made
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:121658:259"/>how ſhall the Popiſh Prieſts be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, who preſume daily to perſwade the people they offer in their Maſs a Propitiatory ſacrifice, and the ſame that was offered by Chriſt himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs? Which if it be ſo, then may we ſay of them, that they crucifie again the Lord of life; whereas the Scripture tels us plainly, he was not to be offered often, as the High-prieſt offered every year, but onely once did put away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. For as a man muſt once die, ſo Chriſt was once offered, to take away ſins for many; and to them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Every Prieſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth daily miniſtring, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ofttimes one manner of offering, which can never take away ſins; but Chriſt (after he had offered one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſins) for ever ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a rule in Logick, <hi>Dato uno abſurdo, mille ſequuntur;</hi> the Papiſts deduce this Doctrine from their other errors of Tranſubſtantiation, and ſo they proceed from iniquity to iniquity:
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:121658:259"/>they hereby, when they have made the people believe their tranſubſtantiated god, that now they may as well rob God of his office, and their Prieſt may make a Propitiatory ſacrifice upon the Altar for the ſins of the people, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith was onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Chriſt himſelf; <hi>He himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the holy place by his own blood:</hi> It was the office of himſelf, to offer himſelf the ſatisfactory oblation for our ſins by the will of the Father, he being the High-prieſt of good things to come, having an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Prieſt-hood, being holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſeparate from ſin, made high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the heavens, which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not daily to offer up ſacrifice, as the other High-prieſt did, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the peoples; for that did he once, when he offered himſelf up once for all.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when the Popiſh Prieſts take upon them to offer up ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacrifice at their Altar, it muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be underſtood ſuch a ſacrifice as the Prieſt under the Law offered, which were but typical of the Meſſias, and ſo they become Jewes, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:121658:260"/>Chriſt to be already come, or elſe if they think they offer Chriſt upon the Altar for quick and dead, and make the ſame oblation which Chriſt made upon the Croſs, they do hereby either deny the ſufficiency of Chriſts oblation, as if his offering once for all, did not ſatisfie without their daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and crucifie again the Lord of life; or elſe, if that ſacrifice of Chriſt was ſufficient, they muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that this of theirs is vain and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, being added to the ſacrifice which is already ſufficient and perfect; or if this of theirs be requiſite, they make the death of Chriſt of none effect, or in vain, becauſe this their offering is ſatisfactory for the ſinnes of the people.</p>
               <p>This doctrine is very well known to have ſprung up of lucre, the Prieſts by this doctrine finding a means to ſell Maſſes for the quick, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for and in conſideration of ſuch and ſuch Legacies, to ſay ſo many Maſſes for the dead, whereby they ſhould be releaſed from pains in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; and finding the ſweet benefit that doth ariſe by this doctrine to the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:121658:260"/>Prieſts and to his Holineſs, by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the other of Indulgences, they bend all their wits, and wholly apply themſelves to darken the truth, with the miſts of ſubrile ſophiſtry and fleſhly interpretations of the word, to gain grateful and liberal Proſelytes to this their new doctrine.</p>
               <p>I do not deny that this Sacrament is by ſome Fathers called a ſacrifice; it is ſo properly called: but it muſt not be therefore underſtood to be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, onely a ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving; or elſe it is called a ſacrifice, to put us in mind of the ſacrifice which Chriſt himſelf hath made, and ſo is ſignificantly a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as the bread is called his body, and the cup his blood: And herewith agreeth Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> in his 33. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plſtle to <hi>Boniface,</hi> and in his book <hi>de civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. That (ſaith he) which men call a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is a figure and repreſentation of the true ſacrifice. And <hi>Magiſt. Sentent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſtic.</hi> 12. That which is offered and conſecrated of the Prieſt, is called a ſacrifice, becauſe it is the memory or repreſentation of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:121658:261"/>the true ſacrifice of Chriſt, and that holy oblation made in the Altar of the Croſs. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the <hi>Hebr.</hi> That which we offer, is but in remembrance of Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: he himſelf in his own Perſon made a ſacrifice for our ſins upon the Croſs, by whoſe wounds all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are healed, all our ſins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo did never any man or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but he; the benefit whereof, is in no mans power to give unto another, every man muſt receive it at Chriſts hands, himſelf, by his own faith and belief: we are made one body, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are partakers of one bread. If then this be a repreſentation of Chriſts ſacrifice, which ſacrifice (by the Doctors own confeſſion) is not perfect without the cup, then muſt the people either receive both kinds, or elſe they do not ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate Chriſts ſacrifice, which they ought to do, in reſpect the Prieſt doth not, nor can offer up a Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory ſacrifice for the Reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>As this Sacrament has the name of a ſacrifice, it is to be underſtood
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:121658:261"/>ſignificantly of Chriſts ſacrifice; or elſe as it is in it ſelf a ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving: if it be ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſacrifice, the people ought to be partakers of it as it is a perfect ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in both kinds: and if it be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe and laud unto the Lord, then the people (as well as the Prieſt) are required to, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that ſervice, as it is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the enſuing Chapter: The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion of all penitent hearts, their acknowledging of Chriſts bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, their thankſgiving for the ſame, their faith and conſolation in Chriſt, their humble ſubmiſſion to his will, is a ſacrifice of laud and prayſe accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God, no leſs then the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt did not ordain this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that any one might receive it for another; but that every one for himſelf is to be made partaker of this myſtery of his ſalvation: For, as one may not be baptized for another (for the Godfathers anſwering for the child, ſay he hath faith, becauſe he hath the Sacrament of faith by the outward element of water; which as it
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:121658:262"/>ſelf cleanſeth, ſo the childe thereby is born again of water and of the Spirit to newneſs of life;
<note place="margin">Baptiſm.</note> the infant ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receiving regeneration by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward element of the water, according to the effectual working of the holy Spirit, unto newneſs of life; the infant being thereby made a member of Chriſt, by faith in Jeſus given unto him in that Sacrament of Baptiſm. So may not one receive this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for another: <hi>Let every man be baptized,</hi> Act. 2. here is ſpiritual regeneration to every man by himſelf. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. Chriſt ſaid to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Take, and eat, and drink ye all of this:</hi> and here is ſpiritual growth and living in Chriſt every man by himſelf; and by this means, we that are many branches, become one Vine, being baptized into one Spirit, and all made to drink into one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Doctor urges, that thoſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> were ſpoken to the Apoſtles, and that therefore the cup is not to be given to the people; He might as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they ſhall not have the bread,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:121658:262"/>becauſe Chriſt gave that to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: whereas all Divines agree, that what was ſpoken to them, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by meant of the whole Church upon earth, which are all the Saints of God upon earth &amp; of particular Churches, whenſoever aſſembled into a Society: which is manifeſt by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who delivered to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that which he had received formerly of the Lord Jeſus, to wit, both the bread and the cup; enjoyning every one to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf, and ſo let him eat, and ſo let him drink. By which it is plain, that it was to be delivered to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in both kindes. And if one kinde had been ſufficiently ſignificant of Chriſts fleſh and blood offered by himſelf upon the Croſs for our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, ſure Chriſt would never have added the cup as part of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thereby to ſignifie his blood, if already it had been ſufficiently ſignified in the bread. Wherefore, unleſs the Papiſts will charge Chriſt to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in his inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they muſt allow the cup unto the people, as well as bread; and both as well as one.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, the Doctor would juſtifie the change of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular, upon the authority of the Church given by Chriſt to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſo to do. And for this he urges S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who was dead five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty yeers before ever this doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> was heard of.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſtood much for the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancie of the bread and wine, that this Sacrifice was but a repreſentation of Chriſts Sacrifice; and that which you ſee on the Altar (or Table) is the bread; and the cup which your eyes ſhew you, is the wine: but, ſaith he, faith ſheweth that that bread is the body, and that cup is the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. It was the practice of the Church in his time, to adminiſter in both kindes: he, when he lived, taught the neceſſity of wine, againſt thoſe that mingled water: and ſo did <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others: and now that they are dead, the Doctor will have them teach another doctrine. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> might ſay, that Chriſt left autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his Apoſtles to make ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in what order this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be received; as, whether
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:121658:263"/>ſitting, kneeling, how often, or the like; but not that they ſhould inſtitute a new Sacrament: Chriſt gave both Elements, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> delivered both, according as he had received, and it was to be done in remembrance of Chriſt, and they were commanded to be imitators of him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. Chriſt left this as a Legacy to his Church, and he made the Apoſtles Executors of this his laſt Will and Teſtament; which they were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, by diſpenſing that Legacy to Chriſts faithful Saints and People. Wherefore for them to withhold part of the thing bequeathed, to wit, the participation of the cup: which is by S. <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>The Communion of his blood,</hi> is to forfeit that truſt Chriſt has repoſed in them, and to forget his precept he enjoyned them, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to teach all Nations whatſoever he had commanded them.</p>
               <p>We are bound to hold faſt the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we have learned. If then the Scripture tell us, that Chriſt with his Apoſtles did communicate in both kinds, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adminiſtring to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Traditi vobis
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:121658:264"/>quod accepi a Domini.</hi> how comes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to forſake this tradition which Chriſt himſelf taught and practiſed, and the Primitive Church for a thouſand yeers held for faith? if it ought to be reduced to one kind, how came it to paſs to be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſo long? and by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth <hi>Rome</hi> claim this power? ſith the ancient Fathers and the Primitive Church, did not onely uſe to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the people in both kinds, but maintained and defended the neceſſity of Bread and Wine, the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Sacrament; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Teſtimony of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Fathers; and particularly it was the profeſſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> Biſhop thereof witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p>Shall but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſcribe any new rule of faith or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and ſhall any diſobey, he is ſtraightwaies anathematized for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting off the Tradition of the Church: and the Catholick Church upon earth communicated in both k nds; and ſhall the late Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> alter this and eſcape the cenſures? Were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:121658:264"/>for it but the bare uſage of the Primitive Churches, it were enough to convince the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but whenas there is Chriſts precept and inſtitution for it, how doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> juſtly incur the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Phariſees teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the commandments of men, and laying aſide the commandments, of God, follow their own traditions? <hi>Mark</hi> 7. But ſuch was the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wickedneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe dayes, that ſcarce any Apoſtolick Rule but has ſuffered ſome alteration by his Holineſs, and his Legiſlative conclave of Cardinals; who being ſoared to a height above Councels, Princes, and all other Powers on earth, ſtick not to wreſtle againſt theſe commandments of the God of Heaven; witneſs their additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Baptiſme, as if the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme wherewith Chriſt was Baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were not ſufficient, without the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſpittle and ſalt; and as if this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bread and Wine were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous as to the cup, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> adminiſters in one kind, as if
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:121658:265"/>nothing were perfect and to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Catholick Church, but what his Holineſs pleaſe to teach and allow. And their reaſons are ſo weak they offer for ſuch their alterations, that any one may plainly diſcern it is <hi>Will,</hi> not <hi>Reaſon,</hi> brings her into ſuch changes. Who but knows that Chriſt as he was man, and the Apoſtles like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, were obnoxious to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of ſpilling the Wine (as the Doctor alledges) or part ſticking upon their beards, as the people of theſe dayes are? But they knowing that it was Chriſts order to ſeparate the cup from the bread, and give it to be divided amongſt them, (thereby denoting to them how his blood ſhould be ſeparated from his fleſh) and by Chriſt left as a pattern for them to follow, and to have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance till his comming again, they, by eating the bread, and drinking the cup, ſhew the Lords death till he come; and for that the ſame was to be continued in remembrance thereof; and they being commanded likewiſe hereunto, <hi>Drink ye all of this: Let a man examine himſelf,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:121658:265"/>and let him eat, and let him drink;</hi> They would not (and we dare not) admit of <hi>Romes</hi> alteration, but deſire of God to hold faſt this truth we have received, and that it would pleaſe him to confirm us herein, that we may be blameleſs in the day of the Lord Jeſus; praying that all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as in this, ſo in all other points of faith and doctrine, may be of one conſent, and firmly united together in one mind and one judgement; that we may all proceed in one Rule, and walk together as followers of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, having them for an enſample to us, that we may with one mind and one mouth praiſe God, even the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:121658:266"/>which were onely for inſtruction and edification of the Auditors, and not at all to be underſtood to gainſay the Lyturgie of <hi>Romes</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning is as well meant of the one, as of the other: for verſ. 26. <hi>When ye come</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, according as every one hath a tongue, or hath interpretation, let it be done to edifying.</hi> By which it is plain; that both praiſes and prayers, Pſalms as well as doctrine, ought to be with underſtanding.

I will, for the better ſatisfaction of thoſe that ſeem to be ſatisfied with the Doctor's expoſition of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> offer theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to his conſideration, againſt thoſe

                     </gap>ne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice firſt ſet up.</note> that the firſt Latine Service that ever was at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> was <hi>anno</hi> 687. whenas the ſixth Councel, there held was aſſembled: for, before that, it was never had in the Latine, but in the Greek or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue. But now was the Pope grown to be univerſal, by the late donation of <hi>Phocas,</hi> for counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing his murder of <hi>Mauritius:</hi> and it did not ſtand with his new-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired honour and dignity, that the Language of any other Church ſhould be preferred before that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore at a General Councel (the repreſentative of the ſeveral Churches) muſt the Language of the Romane See be preferred before any other. For as the Pope was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Head, he muſt needs have an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tongue, otherwiſe his Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality were dumb. And this was the true ground of compoſing the Latine Lyturgie; and not (as the Doctor would perſwade us becauſe it was the moſt general Tongue: for whenas this was conſented unto by many other
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:121658:268"/>Biſhops, to pleaſe the Lordly Pope, the Emperours great favourite, it gave occaſion for the ſpreading of that Language, becauſe the Service began to be in many places in it; not that it was ſo copious or known a Tongue before. Nor doth the reaſon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor brings, juſtifie, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Latine Lyturgie: for, ſaith he, the Lyturgie of the Eaſtern Churches was uſed in Greek, though all the Eaſtern parts ſpoke not that Language; therefore why may not <hi>Rome</hi> preſcribe a Lyturgie in Latine to the Weſtern Churches? To which I anſwer: It was thought fit, by the Fathers of the Primitive Church, to have one uniform Lyturgie in all the Churches upon earth; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o that end, did thoſe then-viſible Churches uſe the Greek Tongue: Why has the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſet up another form? By this, the Doctor contradicts her Antiquity, and the other mark, that ſhe ſhould never have ſeparated from a Society more ancient then her ſelf; or elſe den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es her Univerſality, in that ſhe is but to preſcribe a Latine Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the Weſtern Churcbes: and ſo
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:121658:268"/>he makes thoſe marks by which he would have her diſtinguiſhed to be a true Church, to become Brands and Stigmatizings of her errors, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another reaſon the Doctor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces, is this; that there are many words in peoples Languages, which are hard to be underſtood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may as well have all in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, for that the common people do not underſtand every word they ſpeak.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to me a very ſtrange Argument: whilſt he thus ſtrives to clear this point, he doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, or obſcure the truth; for this is <hi>ignotum per ignotius,</hi> becauſe the common people do not underſtand all the words of their Language, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall underſtand none at all; he may perchance perſwade ſome fool that is blind of the one eye, to put out the other, to make them both alike: but he muſt bring ſtronger reaſons, and prove himſelf a better Scholar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> elſe it will be hard for him to turn our Engliſh into Latine, and make the Lyturgie of other Churches to ſpeak the Romane tongue.</p>
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:121658:269"/>
               <p>When <hi>Vitalianus</hi> decreed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſervice, Greek was more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known then the Latine; inſomuch that in ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine was not ſpoken; as in <hi>Calabria</hi> the Greek was ſpoken, in <hi>Itruria</hi> the <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> in <hi>Apulia</hi> the <hi>Meſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> tongue, the Latine being onely the proper language of the territories of <hi>Latium,</hi> in which <hi>Rome</hi> is ſituate: neither was any thing generall wrote but in the Greek tongue: ſo that if it was convenient to have the Lyturgie in one tongue univerſally, the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Greek into Latine was at firſt unlawful, in reſpect of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the language in thoſe daies; it being done onely out of oſtentation, and for the glory of the Romane See, to make others receive the Latine Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, after ſhe had ſurreptitiouſly acquired the title of Univerſality.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas the Doctor alledges, If the Lyturgie ſhould be in diſtinct proper languages of ſeveral people, whether could the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> underſtand the errors therein, nor they be ſure there were none in it? This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues <hi>Romes</hi> intolerable arrogancy, as
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:121658:269"/>if none could be Chriſtians, which had not received the faith from her; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtles were ſent to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and preached the Goſpel in their own languages; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the faith by Apoſtolical planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is equally juſt with them, to correct <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhe to correct them; both being herein bound to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a general Councel, ſending thither ſome one or other, which ſhall in ſome general language there, make known their caſe. Beſides, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Doctors has given <hi>Rome</hi> a moſt deadly blow: for if <hi>Rome</hi> be the onely Catholick Church, and her Biſhop have all Apoſtolical power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon her own head, certainly ſhe is either enabled to teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or elſe it will follow, that thoſe people which have not yet received the faith, muſt ſtill remain in darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Rome</hi> wants the gift of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tongues, and knows not how to make them underſtand the Goſpel of Jeſus: and for that faith comes by hearing, not by dumb ſhewes, unleſs <hi>Rome</hi> be able to make ſuch people underſtand ſervice and
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:121658:270"/>prayer, they will think her Prieſts are mad. It is not his praiſing God with an underſtanding heart that can edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them: though the Prieſt ſhould praiſe the Lord upon the Harp, they will but think as the Negroes did when they firſt heard Bag-pipes, that they were living creatures, and aſcribe Deity to them; and ſo inſtead of preaching Jeſus, or offering praiſe to him, they would make the people commit Idolatry, if the Prieſt knew not how to perſwade them of their errors, much leſs to make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed rules; and ſo by this means the Doctor has confeſſed the people to want Brains correſpondent to his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal head.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Doctor alledges,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of languages.</note> that all Languages are not of equal extent, and therefore incongruities would ariſe; Beſides (ſayes he) the inconvenience of having it in Latine, is but in part, and that to the ignorant: I conceive theſe reaſons make rather againſt it, then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>It is true, all Languages are not of the ſame latitude; in ſome Languages
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:121658:270"/>one word comprehending ſeveral word in another language; God has given to every Nation ſeveral gifts of tongues. Reaſon taught men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of confuſed and indictinct ſounds articulate ſillables and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar words, to ſignifie their own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and time and Art hath perfected thoſe beginnings: ſo that now every Nation abounds in its own language, the languages of the Nations being at firſt made different, according to the different imaginations of ſeveral people, at the firſt compoſing of ſuch languages; but yet nothing that is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, but they have, or can give a name whereby to repreſent to their ſenſes the nature of the thing: or if they already have a name for any thing, and do not know the reaſon of that denomination, yet they reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the articulate ſound of the words which brings, unto their mind the thing intended and meant. Now becauſe of thoſe ſeveral Nations and people, which at firſt invented ſeveral different languages, (inſomuch that in the language of one Country, one word may comprehend a pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:121658:271"/>of another) that therefore ſuch a Countries language is too ſhort, it muſt not be imagined: For though to ſtrangers it ſeem imperfect, yet amongſt themſelves, it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſcribe the thing intended; wherefore I ſhould think, that (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Doctors objection) it were fit that every Nation had a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie in its own proper language: it perchance may ſeem to ſome to breed incongruities, but indeed it doth not; it denotes the difference of languages in reſpect of latitude or extent, but it retains a royal and concuring ſenſe and underſtanding of the thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their fancy; without which, the people muſt for ever remain in darkneſs, and lockt up in ignorance; which was not Gods will: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſent them eſpecially to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. God is light, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the tender day-ſpring from on high, which hath viſited us; to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet in the way of peace: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:121658:271"/>for <hi>Rome</hi> to take away this light, to let this inconvenience, (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſays to be upon the ignorant) is not to diſcharge the office of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who were ſent out to bring into light them that ſit in darkneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>To them that ſate in darkneſs, is light riſen up. Jeſus came into the world a light,</hi> ſays S. <hi>John, John</hi> 12.46. <hi>that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believeth in him, ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in darkneſs. Whether Jewes or Gentiles, we are one ſheep under one Shepherd, Chriſt Jeſus. John</hi> 10.16. Wherefore for the Doctor (to extenuate this error of <hi>Rome</hi>) to ſay, that the inconvenience is onely to the ignorant, is to me a ſtrange Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for, <hi>The whole have no need of a Phyſitian, but the ſick, Matth.</hi> 9. Chriſt having ſent his Apoſtles to preach him, that is, light unto them that ſit in darkneſs, and to bring them unto this marvellous light: So that it is the principal part of the Prieſts du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to propagate the Goſpel to them that yet remain in darkneſs, and not to keep them in ignorance, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from this light by clouding
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:121658:272"/>their Intellects with a Vail of dark language: a Candle ought not to be ſet under a Buſhel; let your light ſhine before men, that others ſeeing, may glorifie God which is in heaven: give then to the ſeveral people their Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in their own tongue, that they may underſtandingly, and with a contrite heart, offer up their ſacrifice of Prayer and praiſe, which is a reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and acceptable ſervice to God; for if a people ignorant of the Latine, muſt have their Lyturgie in that tongue, theſe inconveniences and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities do from thence ariſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the praiſe and ſervice of God ſaid by the Miniſter, (who knowes what he ſaith) be ſufficiently accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God: it is to no purpoſe for the people (which underſtand it not) to come to hear it; which to aſſert, were Diabolical, in reſpect that God has commanded all to draw neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whether Jew or Gentile; as many as believe in Jeſus, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Who being conſecrate, is made the Author of ſalvation unto all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. <hi>There is no difference between the Jew
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:121658:272"/>and the Grecian; he that is Lord of all, is rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> Rom. 10. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tels us, that <hi>In every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Acts 10. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you,</hi> Matth. 12. <hi>Call upon me in trouble, and I will hear you,</hi> Pſal. 17.6. <hi>He is nigh unto all them that call upon him faithfully,</hi> Pſal. 145.18.

                  </hi> Matth. 18.</p>
               <p>Now as all are enjoyned to this duty, ſo is it requiſite that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it with due reverence; knowing to whom they ſpeak, and not with raſh lips, nor ignorantly; for the word muſt be in thy heart, as well as thy mouth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. The men of <hi>Athens</hi> worſhipped an unknown God, but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rebuketh them <hi>Acts</hi> 11. <hi>Be ye not ſtrangers from the life of God, through ignorance,</hi>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:121658:273"/>(was S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) but underſtand what the will of the Lord is.</hi> So that as all people are commanded to ſerve and praiſe God, ſo muſt they do it in heart and mind, and with underſtanding; wherefore it is not ſufficient onely for the Prieſt to underſtand when he prayes or praiſeth God, but the people likewiſe muſt concur in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the preſent ſervice: If it be ſufficient for the Prieſt alone to know and underſtand the prayer and praiſes offered to God, then need not the people come; or if the coming of the people be neceſſary, then muſt they underſtand what the Prieſt prays or ſaith: For if a man pray <hi>Pater noſter, &amp;c.</hi> as the Doctor ſayes, <hi>fol.</hi> 339. and may not meaſure his thoughts Mathematically with his words, it is no more than if a Parat were taught it; his underſtanding is without fruit: in a Rational ſoul, the heart is to declare to the tongue, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, whilſt he ſpeaks, he either babbles like a Bruit, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (<hi>A good man out of the good treaſure, bringeth forth good;
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:121658:273"/>an evil man, out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth evil: For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaks; Luk.</hi> 6.) or otherwiſe, if there be no concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the heart and the mouth, he ſpeaks with feigned lips, not uttering what he thinks. It is not ſufficient for a man to ſuppoſe it is the Lords prayer, becauſe he has heard ſo, and that he knows the Lords prayer in Engliſh, or that his thoughts go along with the Latine: For ſuppoſe he ſhould be ſaying <hi>Da nobis panem quotidianum,</hi> and he was ſuppoſing he was praying for the Kingdome to come, how ſhall God anſwer ſuch a prayer?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Doctor (whilſt he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet up the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her fellowes, and to magnifie her Lyturgie, he) doth indeed deſtroy Chriſt's Church, by excluding the people who are Members of the Church, and make a Church, as I have ſhewed in the third Chapter. For it is not the practice at <hi>Rome</hi> onely in Quires, and in Collegiate Chappels, which are onely for ſocieties of ſuch
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:121658:274"/>as underſtand that tongue, this were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rable; but it extends to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, excluding the people, which is abominable: For, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though ſhe be Head, ſhe cannot ſay unto the Members, <hi>I have no need of you:</hi> We all make but one body in Chriſt, whether we be Jewes or Gentiles, bond or free: <hi>We are all by one Spirit baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. So then, if the ſociety of the Saints do make the Church, it is fit that this ſociety ſerve and praiſe the Lord in heart and ſpirit, for as God is a ſpirit, ſo he will be worſh pped in ſpirit and in truth. Wherefore, to ſay, that it is ſufficient for the Prieſt to underſtand, becauſe he alone offers the ſacrifice of praiſe; that is to deſtroy the Church, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Saints from this duty: and therefore, that they may do this with heart and ſpirit, it is requiſite for the people to have this Lyturgie in a tongue they underſtand, that they may praiſe the Lord with all their heart, according as the Lyturgie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns then, bidding them lift up their
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:121658:274"/>heart unto the Lord. And I much wonder, that theſe words eſcaped razing, when <hi>Vitellianus</hi> about the year 666. (the number of the Beaſt) did command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the ſervice in all Churches ſhould be in Latine; but <hi>Nihil ſimul eſt inventum &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum:</hi> and now that it remains ſtill, having eſcaped the <hi>Index expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> it ſtands to the condemnation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſhew from what ſhe is fallen; from truth, to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; from Apoſtolick practice, to let all things be done to edifying 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.11. to follow her own inventions, hood-winking the people in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that ſhe may the better tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over them. For whereas the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would perſwade us, <hi>fol.</hi> 329. that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> uſed a Lyturgie in one of the learned languages, which could not be known to all; he muſt prove that, before it be to be believed: It may be they uſed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one conſtant language in their ſervice, which might not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by others, by chance by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but when they preached or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with others, in a publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:121658:275"/>we do not finde but that the people underſtood them in their own language.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our prayer and praiſe ought to be in faith, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask, if ye believe, ye ſhall receive it, Matth.</hi> 21.22. We muſt come unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Sons Name, and he will hear us; ask, and he will do it, <hi>John</hi> 14.14. <hi>By faith in Jeſus, we have boldneſs and entrance with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Eph.</hi> 3.12. So that <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we deſire when we pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we ſhall have it, and it ſhall be done unto us Mark</hi> 11.24. But <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> For <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, Heb.</hi> 11. And without faith, our prayer turns into ſin; for, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14.23. So then, for any ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to come to Divine ſervice in a Tonge they do not underſtand, their prayer and praiſe cannot be of faith, in reſpect they know not what they ask; their Prieſt is their mouth, and they cannot in heart go along with
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:121658:275"/>him, becauſe they underſtand not what he ſayes; and their ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to they know not what, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God; according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Romanes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall we call on him in whom we have not believed? and how ſhall we believe in him, of whom we have not heard?</hi> We muſt believe in him, and by him, and by him offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God; we muſt draw neer unto him with a pure heart, in the aſſurance of faith, <hi>Heh.</hi> 10.22. This was the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and this was the practice of the Primitive Churches.</p>

               <p>I Have briefly touched moſt of thoſe points which the Doctor hath urged againſt the Proteſtants; wherein (I conceive) the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth differ from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and for that it is not my deſire to make the breaches wider, but (if poſſible) to reconcile them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, and to make up the gap of ſeparation betwixt them, I now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to a concluſion. Yet let not any one cenſure me, as if I were weary of my enterprize, becauſe to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chapters I have not given parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular anſwers: for I conceive, that the ſcope of their matter is ſufficiently
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:121658:277"/>refuted in this diſcourſe; and thoſe Chapters not concerning any points of controverſie betwixt us, any further than I have already anſwered, I did therefore forbear to multiply words againſt the Doctor, but haſtned to the concluſion.</p>
               <p>The Doctor in his 22. and 23. Chapters, doth flutter with the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, and makes moſt buſsle, when he is furtheſt off the Neſt: He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly caſt his ſting, and there (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) ends with buzzing and noiſe onely; he rolls up himſelf in Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and with the <hi>Seriphian</hi> Froggs (of which <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 85.) he is clamorous in invectives; he, (like an untamed Colt) having leaped the Pale, which kept him in a ſafe and fitting Paſture, ranges up and down the miry paths, throwing up dirt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: till at length (having run himſelf out of breath) he becomes tame, and is content to take ſcraps at the Jeſuites hands: he feeds upon the Orts of <hi>Parſons, Saunders,</hi> and ſuch like Renegadoes; he has turned away his face from <hi>England</hi>'s Sion, in whoſe true mirror of divinity, he might
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:121658:278"/>have ſeen the image of Chriſt himſelf, and his own face beauteous, as a Son of that Church; but now having turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide, he has forgot what manner of man he was, or what before he had beheld by the help of the reflections; and now he altogether contemplates upon a falſe gloſs, which doth preſent unto him deceiving objects: on the one hand is the Church of <hi>England,</hi> preſented to him black and ugly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing transformed by the falſe Vail they (and ſuch like) have put upon her; for which they are (with all indulgence) cheriſhed and encouraged by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, according to the ſaying of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. 26.22. <hi>The words of a Tale-bearer are as flatterings, and they go down into his belly.</hi> But on the other hand, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſet out. with all the Art ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; ſo that any who will give up himſelf unto the ſpeculative Religion of Popery, is cheated into an opinion of <hi>Romes</hi> beauty and comlineſs, and into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:121658:278"/>finde, that <hi>Englands</hi> Church (which is thus preſented to him, is <hi>black</hi> but <hi>comely;</hi> and, like the curtains of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> is ſet all with precious Stones and Jewels on her inner ſide, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>I am black, but comly; as the curtains of Salomon.</hi> And if he pleaſe to make inquiſition into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he will finde, that ſhe has onely a glorious outſide, ſhe is a painted <hi>Jezebel,</hi> that cares not to venter through a Sea of blood, to take poſſeſſion of her Neighbours Vineyards, cauſing the Prophets of the Lord to be ſlain, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18. She is Harpy-like, with a fair face, and a foul heart; and in that fair face (were but the Ignatian paint taken off) would rivelled browes, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn cheeks appear. How much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Doctors caſe to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who hath joyned himſelf to the Heathen, to open his mouth that he may praiſe the power of the Idols, and to magnifie a fleſhly King for ever, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>Hence is it, that in his ſecond and third Chapters, taking for granted that <hi>Rome</hi> is the onely Catholick
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:121658:279"/>Church, and her Biſhop <hi>Peter</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and abſolute and ſole poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of all Apoſtolical Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; he doth hereupon conclude, that the Proteſtant Churches are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Conventicles, and that they know not the Scriptures, without the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor can diſperſe and teach them without Commiſſion from thence.</p>
               <p>Now for that it is my deſire, not to multiply words, I will forbear any particular anſwer to theſe Aſſertions; and refer the Reader to my ſecond Chapter, where his Holineſs Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality is fully refuted.</p>
               <p>And as touching that Aſſertion of his, concerning the Scriptures, my 2.8.11. and 12. Chapters are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent anſwers: where firſt I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved equal Commiſſion; then, that the Scriptures are to judge the truth of themſelves, Traditions, and Councels; and that other Churches had the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and not from <hi>Rome;</hi> that the Provincials of Apoſtolical plantation, have equal power, having the ſame Spirit to guide them, as by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means the viſible ſign of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:121658:279"/>grace given in the Sacrament of order, is in Chriſtian charity to be preſumed; and therefore may as well judge of thoſe points of Scripture, which admit of explanation, as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the many arguments uſed by the Doctor in thoſe Chapters, are not onely grounded upon falſe ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but in themſelves are injurious, wrongfully accuſing the Church of <hi>England,</hi> laying opinions to her charge concerning the wayes and means to underſtand the meaning of thoſe Scriptures, which ſhe doth not profeſs as Doctrinal.</p>
               <p>And then in the 22. Chapter, he would diſprove our ground of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>Rome;</hi> as to this, I have in part touched in the 2.4. and 6. Chapters: and in the 11. Chapter I have proved aright in Provincials to reform Schiſmes and Hereſies: And whereas he ſaies we ought not to have ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> hecaſe (ſaith he) we pretending the truth of our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ought to have demonſtrated them to the world, whereby to have reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to have ſeparated our ſelves: To this I anſwer.</p>
               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:121658:280"/>
               <p>The firſt occaſion of the ſeparation, was about the difference of the Popes Supremacy; and he having in a high way got the upper hand of many Churches, which were vaſſallized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his power, and the Councels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo abuſed, and made invalid by the late <hi>Lateran</hi> Prerogative; it was to no purpoſe to offer the difference to a general Councel, which muſt either act for, or not againſt his Holineſs; having no power to decree any thing againſt his Holineſs, as I have proved in the tenth Chapter. This gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to other Provinces, (which could get opportunity) to back the right and priviledge proper to their own Sees, to caſt off any further appealing, either thither or to <hi>Rome.</hi> And they knowing this to be an uſurpation in Popes, it gave them occaſion to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth of many other of her Doctrines; and betaking themſelves to the holy word of God delivered to them, and approved through all ages for the verities of God himſelf; and ſearching into the Primitive Churches, and practices of the antient Fathers, they found <hi>Rome</hi> to have
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:121658:280"/>changed her faith, as thoſe particulars I have already treated on make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vincentius adverſus Hereticos</hi> ſayes, that Doctrine is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catholick, <hi>quod ſemper &amp; ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus credendum eſt;</hi> and if this muſt be the rule, then are neither we Hereticks, nor <hi>Rome</hi> Catholick: <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be ſaid Catholick, in reſpect the faith of Chriſt was at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places profeſſed, when it was not at all at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor may we be by her called Hereticks, becauſe ſhe has changed.</p>
               <p>The Doctor (upon Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s rule, <hi>fol.</hi> 120.) ſayes, that Doctrines without known beginnings, are not to be diſputed againſt; but thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which I have treated, I have fairly proved them to be innovations; and therefore by that we are not to be cenſured for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Doctor ſayes that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt either be the true Church, or elſe there is none, he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by proves himſelf to be in darkneſs: he has confeſſed it in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:121658:281"/>her planting, and in ſeveral other places, I have proved it to have been planted, and not from <hi>Rome;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not neceſſarily to be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (upon the ſcore of her onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the Goſpel) that ſhe is the viſible Church: if the Goſpel be hid, it is hid to thoſe that are loſt; the loſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eep's gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to idolize the pontifical Pope, whom the God of this world hath blinded, that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the Image of God, ſhould not ſhine unto him; for (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake:</hi> Which is neither the Jeſuites Doctrine, (who teach nothing but the infallibility of his Holineſs) nor the Popes profeſſion, who would every where be a Maſter, but no ſervant to the Saints and people of God. We therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his change from this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and becauſe of his intolerable pride and uſurpations, and as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches ſhake him off, but do not change from the Primitive faith taught by the Apoſtles, and formes
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:121658:281"/>maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And though we lay long under <hi>Romes</hi> innovation, yet this is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Doctor to urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, that we ſhould not at all reform; Chriſt has withdrawn his Spirit for a time from ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as I have proved in the 5. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Magna eſt veritas, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valebit:</hi> Truth is ſtronger than all the power of man, as I have proved by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> 1 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 4. And though the Pope (with the inventions and polices of his Cardinal conclave) had ſo warded the ſeveral Churches of the Weſt, that he thought them abſolutely maſtered, and under his command, to be ſervants to do his drudgery; he did (as we ſay) reckon without his Hoſt, he did conſult with fleſh and blood, whilſt a Divine hand maſter'd his humane polices, and their works of darkneſs were brought into light, when leaſt ſuſpected to have them laid open to the world.</p>
               <p>And though the perſons (the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Inſtruments of this ſeparation and change from <hi>Romes</hi> errors) were
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:121658:282"/>not in all things approvable, touching Moral converſation; yet this doth not abſolutely diſprove the truth of their Doctrine, as I have proved in the 6. Chapter. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> accounted Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> an Heretick; and the Jeſuites hold, <hi>Hominem non Chriſtianum poſſe Romanum eſſe Pontificem, quodlib:</hi> 4, <hi>art.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 100. And it is unequal dealing, to cenſure others of that, of which they themſelves will not be condemned. God made uſe of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs to open the eyes of <hi>Balaam;</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> (I crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the compariſon) retorting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Maſter the Pope, who ſmote him and his Princes with <hi>Romes</hi> Thunderbolts, was a means to open the eyes of the Engliſh Clergie, who ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtanding in the way; and I hope none can blame them for hearkning to his voice: we do not in all things approve of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. In thoſe things wherein we do not differ from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe cannot blame us; and in thoſe things wherein we differ, we can prove, that not any one point, but was for 600. yeers after Chriſt by
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:121658:282"/>the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf profeſſed; and ſince has (by the pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of wicked and aſpiring Popes) by little and little been forſaken, and by her deſerted: ſo that who pleaſe impartially to conſider of what I have in this Treatiſe fairly laid down, may plainly perceive, that it is <hi>Rome,</hi> not <hi>England,</hi> has forſaken the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive truth; and whilſt the Doctor, or any other ſhall ſtrive againſt the truth of <hi>England</hi>'s Church, they do but wound their own ſoul; by back-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her, they bring a ſtaffe to their own head; all the injury and miſchief they frame againſt her, falls down on their own Pates; they themſelves are caught in the Net, which they have privily laid for others; all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtrength of Reaſon they bring againſt her in this point, being but ſo many domeſtick witneſſes to their own condemnation. I need not ſtudy reproofs for <hi>Romes</hi> Apoſtacy: it is ſufficient that I have proved her to have changed her faith; and by that means I have returned all the Doctors ingenious upbraidings againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon the Church
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:121658:283"/>of <hi>Rome</hi>'s own ſcore; ſo that I will declaim no longer upon this Theam; I will deliver the reſt with ſighs and groans (the prolocutors of an o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraight heart,) and in anguiſh of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, weep out the reſt of this ſad Scaene; and hanging my Harp (with <hi>David</hi>) upon the Willowes, I will forbear to run any more diviſions upon theſe diſcourſes: heartily beſeeching the Almighty God, to reconcile us into one faith, by the Spirit of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and ſhall from my very ſoul pray,</p>
               <p>That it would pleaſe God to open the heart of the <hi>Romane</hi> Clergy, to ſee their own errors; and that he would in mercy turn unto them, and turn them unto him, and would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly cauſe them to remember from whence they are fallen, and to do their firſt works: and likewiſe, that it would pleaſe him, to put courage and ſtrength into the hearts and hands of Chriſtian Princes and Miniſters, that they might thereby be embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (by the operations and effectual workings of his holy Spirit) to reprove the preſent Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> of the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:121658:283"/>errors of their wayes; knowing this, that if a man rebuke a wiſe man, he will love him; <hi>Give admoniſhment to the wiſe, and he will be wiſer, Prov.</hi> 9. and plainly to let him know how the Church of Chriſt ſuffers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, under his Tyrannical perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilſt he ſits above her Councels, and exerciſes a Legiſlative power over her heavenly treaſure, her Scriptures, left to her by the Apoſtles, and over her Apoſtolical traditions, moulding them into new formes, for to promote thereby the intereſt of the Papal Chair: and likewiſe to let him know, that Councels were the onely means to keep the ſeveral Churches in unity; and that theſe being invalid by the late uſurpations of the Popes, all our diſcords do ariſe from thence; and that till this be freely and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily abandoned, there is no hopes of uniting the neighbouring Churches with her; and that in the mean time, the Pope himſelf is the occaſion of the ſeparations made: and though it be neceſſary that offences come, that there be Hereſies amongſt you, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) that
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:121658:284"/>they which are approved may be known; yet for that the Pope is the cauſe of theſe diviſions and offences, by reaſon of thoſe his unjuſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards the ſeveral Chriſtian Churches, that he might expect the woe denounced by the Evangeliſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>It muſt needs be that offences ſhall come, but woe be to that man by whom the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> and that therefore he would no longer tempt God, by his wilful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in his new-taken-up errors; but that he would (as his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors the Antient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have done before him) caſt himſelf upon a general Councel, utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his late <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi>-Prerogatives, and the injunction of obedience to his Papal Canon-Law; without which there is no hope of reconciling our differences; and by whieh means (by the bleſſing of God) the multitude of Believers may be of one heart, and one ſoul, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem, they ſhall proſper that love her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may all with one minde, and one mouth praiſe God,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:121658:284"/>
                  <hi>even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (Rom. 15.6.) that there may be no diſſentions amongſt us, but that we may be knit together in one minde, and one judgement, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.) that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in one Rule, that we may minde one thing, and have the Apoſtles for our enſample, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. that as Chriſts coat was ſeamleſs, as his Legacy was Peace, ſo we may all be cloathed with Righteouſneſs, and keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord, for thy onely Sonne our Saviour Chriſt his ſake, Amen.</p>
               <p>

            <p>THe injury done to this work through my many miſpriſions, (occaſioned by the difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Character of the Authors hand, whoſe remote abode admitted of no intercourſe to inſtruct me therein, nor had I any in Town ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith to perfect my reading thereof) makes me (as I have already by the interceſſion of a friend begged the Authors pardon, ſo) now by my ſelf gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) humbly to implore yours. I muſt confeſs in ſome places I was forced to gueſs at the Authors meaning, I not being able to read many of his words, by which means I have diſtorted his ſtyle, and obſcured his ingenious phancies, ſometimes by inſerting ſome Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey-wolſey lines of my contexture, in this far purer Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, otherwhiles, by omitting whole ſentences of the Authors: yet theſe variations of mine from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, not admitting of correction (as the Author certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) without ravelling the whole piece, and (to uſe his own phraſe) picking out thoſe knotty ends of mine.
